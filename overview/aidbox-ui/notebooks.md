# Aidbox Notebooks

{% hint style="warning" %}
Aidbox notebooks is a beta. Please join [the discussion](https://github.com/Aidbox/Issues/discussions/412) or [contact](../contact-us.md) us if you want to contribute.
{% endhint %}

A notebook is a single page where you can run code ([REST](../../api-1/api/), [SQL](../../api-1/api/usdpsql.md), [RPC](../../api-1/rpc-api.md)) check the output, and complement it with text. Using Aidbox notebook you can easily create custom scenarios with your Aidbox data, save it for later use or share it with your colleagues and the Aidbox community.

So now you can easily:

* create custom scenarios using different requests.
* share knowledge with your team and Aidbox community
* raise questions and report issues related to Aidbox

## **Functionality**

* REST, SQL, RPC Markdown support in cells
* [Notebook save ](notebooks.md#save-a-notebook)
* [Notebooks repository](notebooks.md#publish-notebook) - space for public notebook storage.
* [Notebook share/preview/upload ](notebooks.md#share-a-notebook)

## Notebooks section in Aidbox UI

When clicking the notebooks tab in Aidbox UI you will get to the notebooks page. This page consists of your personal notebooks and Aidbox community notebooks.

## Share a notebook

To share your Aidbox notebook with others and upload it to another Aidbox, simply click on the `share` button and choose the share method that works best for you — either as a _file_ or a _link_.

&#x20;If you choose to share as a _file_, Aidbox will download the notebook as a `.html` file, which will contain a preview of the notebook.

&#x20;If you choose to share as a _link_, Aidbox will generate a unique link, such as [https://aidbox.app/ExportedNotebook/fa061348-1851-4962-b39e-ba496eba23bd](https://aidbox.app/ExportedNotebook/fa061348-1851-4962-b39e-ba496eba23bd), and copy it to your clipboard. You can also share notebooks directly from the notebooks grid.\
