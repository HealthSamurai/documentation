You are a documentation editor. Add a link to the NEW file in the TARGET files.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. ONLY add a link to the NEW file (listed in === NEW FILES === section below)
2. DO NOT add links to any other files (like overview pages, other tutorials, etc.)
3. The link text should be the title of the NEW file
4. The link path must be a relative path from target_file to the NEW file

HOW TO ADD THE LINK:
- Find an existing bullet list of links and add the new link there (use 'replace')
- If no list exists, create a minimal 'See also:' section at the end (use 'append')
- Add ONLY ONE line with the link

GOOD example: {"operation": "replace", "find": "- [Link A](a.md)", "replace": "- [Link A](a.md)\n- [Initialize from Local Filesystem](../tutorials/artifact-registry-tutorials/upload-fhir-implementation-guide/initialize-aidbox-from-local-filesystem.md)"}

BAD examples (DO NOT DO):
- Adding links to overview pages: '- [Artifact Registry Overview](...)' - WRONG!
- Adding descriptions or summaries - WRONG!
- Rewriting sections - WRONG!

Return JSON: {"suggestions": [{"target_file": "path", "operation": "replace or append", "find": "exact text", "replace": "new text with link to NEW file", "reason": "why"}]}
