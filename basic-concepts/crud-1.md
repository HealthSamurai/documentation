# CRUD

This part of documentation describes how to create, read, update, and delete resources. Also, it covers some advanced topics like conditional create, update, and delete. Aidbox REST API slightly differs from canonical FHIR REST API. There is the [article]() which describes those differences.

All sample requests can be run from the Postman collection:[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/view-collection/cd401dd93c5efab171ac?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.getpostman.com%2Frun-collection%2Fcd401dd93c5efab171ac%23%3Fenv[Aidbox.Cloud]%3DW3sia2V5IjoiYmFzZTEiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbWVyZWRpdGguYWlkYm94LmFwcCIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIiwiZW5hYmxlZCI6ZmFsc2V9LHsia2V5IjoiYmFzZSIsInZhbHVlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9wYXZseXNoaW5hMjAxODExMDkuYWlkYm94LmFwcCIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIiwiZW5hYmxlZCI6dHJ1ZX1d&_ga=2.141573233.23745025.1543592968-654445837.1543359065)

## Introduction

A **resource** is an object with a type, associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it \(information about it can be found in FHIR [specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) or through Aidbox [metadata](introspection/custom-metadata.md)\). In most cases a resource represented as a JSON/XML/YAML document.

Each resource has its own resource **type**, this type defines a set of data which can be stored with this resource, and possible relationships with other resources.

**Attribute** is a part of the resource definition which describes what fields can or must be present in the resource document, type of such fields, and their cardinality.

Every resource type has the same set of **interactions** available. These interactions are described below. 

Each interaction can fail with:

* **`403`** **Forbidden** — client is not authorized to perform the interaction

## create

```text
POST [base]/[type]
```

This is one of the most basic interactions which gives an ability to create resources. It uses `POST` HTTP method, accepts a resource type via path parameters, and resource as a body of the request. A response to this interaction may be one of the following:

* **`201`** **Created** — resource successfully created
* **`400`** **Bad Request** — resource could not be parsed or failed basic FHIR validation rules
* **`409`** **Conflict** — resource with such id already exists
* **`422`** **Unprocessable Entity** — the proposed resource violated applicable FHIR profiles or server business rules

A successful response \(`2xx`\) also contains a created resource as a body and additional headers `Location`, `ETag`, `Last-Modified` which contain full path to resource \(base url, resource type and id of newly created resource\), additionally information about version \(vid\) and modification time of that resource.

```text
Location: [base]/[type]/[id]/_history/[vid]
ETag: [vid]
Last-Modified: [modification-datetime]
```

An unsuccessful response  \(`4xx`\) contains `OperationOutcome` resource which describes issues server faced during creation of this resource.

### `201` Created

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```yaml
POST /Patient

name: [{given: ["Bob"]}]
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `201`

```yaml
name:
- given: [Bob]
id: 17b69d79-3d9b-45f8-af79-75f958502763
resourceType: Patient
meta:
  lastUpdated: '2018-11-29T10:44:10.588Z'
  versionId: '13'
  tag:
  - {system: 'https://aidbox.app', code: created}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### `422` Unprocessable entity

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```yaml
POST /Patient

name: "Bob"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `422`

```yaml
resourceType: OperationOutcome
errors:
- path: [name]
  message: expected array
warnings: []
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Aidbox REST API doesn't ignore`id` and treat it as all other attributes in contrast to FHIR API. Read more about differences [here]().
{% endhint %}

## conditional create

```text
POST [base]/[type]?[search parameters]
```

Much more complex way to create a resource \(it requires knowledge of [search](search-1/)\) but it gives some additional flexibility. If you provide search parameters, `create` becomes `conditional create` and works in the following way \(depending on the number of search results\): 

* **No matches**: The server performs a `create` interaction
* **One Match**: The server returns the found resource and `200 OK`
* **Multiple matches**: The server returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error indicating the client's criteria were not selective enough

### `200` OK

Create a patient if there is no patient with name Bob.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```yaml
POST /Patient?name=Bob

name: [{given: ["Bob"]}]
gender: male
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `200`

```yaml
name:
- given: [Bob]
id: 17b69d79-3d9b-45f8-af79-75f958502763
resourceType: Patient
meta:
  lastUpdated: '2018-11-29T10:44:10.588Z'
  versionId: '13'
  tag:
  - {system: 'https://aidbox.app', code: created}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

A patient was not created, an existing patient was returned.

## read

```text
GET [base]/[type]/[id]
```

One of the most basic interactions used to obtain a resource by a given `id`. For more advanced options for getting resources check out [Search](search-1/).

* **`200`** **OK** — resource successfully found and returned
* **`404`** **Not Found —** resource with a given `id` doesn't exist on the server
* **`410`** **Gone —** resource was deleted

### `200` OK

Get an existing patient:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```text
GET /Patient/17b69d79-3d9b-45f8-af79-75f958502763
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `200`

```yaml
name:
- given: [Bob]
id: 17b69d79-3d9b-45f8-af79-75f958502763
resourceType: Patient
meta:
  lastUpdated: '2018-11-29T10:44:10.588Z'
  versionId: '13'
  tag:
  - {system: 'https://aidbox.app', code: created}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### `404` Not Found

Attempt to get a non-existing patient:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```text
GET /Patient/some-not-existing-id
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `404`

```yaml
resourceType: OperationOutcome
status: 404
text: Resource Patient/some-not-existing-id not found
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## vread

```text
GET [base]/[type]/[id]/_history/[vid]
```

This is another read interaction but it returns a specific version resource. Similar to read but additionally requires to specify version id.

### `200` OK

Version id `13` was extracted from the response of a `create` interaction.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```text
GET /Patient/17b69d79-3d9b-45f8-af79-75f958502763/_history/13
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `200`

```yaml
name:
- given: [Bob]
id: 17b69d79-3d9b-45f8-af79-75f958502763
resourceType: Patient
meta:
  lastUpdated: '2018-11-29T10:44:10.588Z'
  versionId: '13'
  tag:
  - {system: 'https://aidbox.app', code: created}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## update

```text
PUT [base]/[type]/[id]
```

This is interaction which allows to modify existing resource \(create a new version of it\). After performing this interaction, the resource will be replaced with a new version of resource provided in the body of the request. `id` of a resource can't be changed \(at least cause of versioning\) and `id` in the body of the resource is ignored in `update` interaction \(it's done to make a `conditional update` possible without knowing logical id of the resource\). If a resource with `id` \(provided in the url\) doesn't exist, new resource will be created. Following codes can be returned by the server:

* **`200`** **OK** — resource successfully updated
* **`201`** **Created** — resource successfully created
* **`422`** **Unprocessable Entity** — the proposed resource violated applicable FHIR profiles or server business rules

### **`200`** OK

Update a patient by given id:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```yaml
PUT /Patient/17b69d79-3d9b-45f8-af79-75f958502763

name: [{given: ["Bob"]}]
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `200`

```yaml
name:
- given: [Bob]
id: 17b69d79-3d9b-45f8-af79-75f958502763
resourceType: Patient
meta:
  lastUpdated: '2018-11-29T13:58:03.875Z'
  versionId: '38'
  tag:
  - {system: 'https://aidbox.app', code: updated}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### `201` Created

Create a patient with specified id:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```yaml
PUT /Patient/tom-id

name: [{given: ["Tom"]}]
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `201`

```yaml
name:
- given: [Tom]
id: tom-id
resourceType: Patient
meta:
  lastUpdated: '2018-11-29T14:01:09.336Z'
  versionId: '40'
  tag:
  - {system: 'https://aidbox.app', code: created}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **versioned update**

While you do update there is a risk of  override latest changes done by another operation. To escape this situation you can use versioned update by sending with update `If-Match` header with `versionId` of resource you want to update. If server has same version of resources update will be successful, if versions do not match - you will get OperationOutcome with conflict code.

#### Example

Let say we created patient:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="create-patient-request" %}
```yaml
POST /Patient

id: pt-1
name: [{family: ['Wrong']}]
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

```yaml
status: 201

resourceType: Patient
id: pt-1
meta: {lastUpdated: '2019-04-04T09:15:25.210Z', versionId: '30'}
name:
- {family: Wrong}
```

Now to fix family for this patient without risk override someone else changes - we use versioned update request: 

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="versioned-update-request" %}
```yaml
PUT /Patient/pt-id
If-Match: 30

name: [{family: ['Smith']}]
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

If someone already touched same patient, his version id was changed and we get OperationOutcome.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="conflict-response" %}
```yaml
status: 409

resourceType: OperationOutcome
id: conflict
text: {status: generated, div: Version Id mismatch}
issue:
- {severity: fatal, code: conflict, diagnostics: Version Id mismatch}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## conditional update

```text
PUT [base]/[type]?[search parameters]
```

This is more complex way to update a resource but it gives more power. It gives the ability to update a resource without knowing `id` but requires knowledge of [Search](search-1/). Different response codes will be returned \(based on the number of search results\):

* **No matches**: The server performs a `create` interaction
* **One Match**: The server performs the update against the matching resource
* **Multiple matches**: The server returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error indicating the client's criteria were not selective enough

### `200` OK

Update the patient by name.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```yaml
PUT /Patient?name=Tom

name: [{given: ["Tom"]}]
gender: male
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `200`

```yaml
name:
- given: [Tom]
gender: male
id: tom-id
resourceType: Patient
meta:
  lastUpdated: '2018-11-29T14:10:31.885Z'
  versionId: '42'
  tag:
  - {system: 'https://aidbox.app', code: updated}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### `201` Created

 Create a patient with the name Julie and specified id if no other patients with the same name exist:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```yaml
PUT /Patient?name=Julie

id: julie-id
name: [{given: ["Julie"]}]
gender: female
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `201`

```yaml
name:
- given: [Julie]
gender: female
id: julie-id
resourceType: Patient
meta:
  lastUpdated: '2018-11-29T14:13:03.416Z'
  versionId: '43'
  tag:
  - {system: 'https://aidbox.app', code: created}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If a patient with name Julie already exists, `update` interaction will be performed and `id` will be ignored.
{% endhint %}

## delete

```text
DELETE [base]/[type]/[id]
```

This interaction deletes a resource, responds with `200 OK` on a successful delete, but on deletion of an already deleted resource it responds with `204 No Content`. 

To get `204 No Content` always instead of `200 OK`, use `_no-content=true` query parameter.

* **`200`** **OK** — resource successfully delete
* **`204`** **No Content** — resource already deleted

### `200` OK

Delete a patient by id:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```text
DELETE /Patient/tom-id
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `200`

```yaml
name:
- given: [Tom]
gender: male
id: tom-id
resourceType: Patient
meta:
  lastUpdated: '2018-11-29T14:33:17.429Z'
  versionId: '44'
  tag:
  - {system: 'https://aidbox.app', code: deleted}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### `204` No Content

Attempt to delete an already deleted resource:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Request" %}
```text
DELETE /Patient/tom-id
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Response" %}
**Status:** `204`

```text

```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## conditional delete

```text
DELETE [base]/[type]?[search parameters]
```

Depending on the number of resources meeting the search criteria, different actions will be performed and response codes will be returned:

* **No matches:** Respond with `404 Not Found`
* **One Match**: The server performs an ordinary `delete` on the matching resource
* **Multiple matches**: Servers respond with `412 Precondition Failed` error indicating the client's criteria were not selective enough
