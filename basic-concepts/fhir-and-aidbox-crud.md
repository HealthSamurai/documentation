# FHIR & Aidbox CRUD

### create

```http
POST [base]/[type]
```

FHIR API [ignores](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#create) `id` in `POST` requests, but Aidbox API respect `id` inside request body and creates resource with specific `id`. This decision was made because we didn't find any reasons to ignore it and to make Aidbox API be closer to sql `INSERT` query. As a result new response code `409 Conflict` appeared:\`

* **`201` Created** - resource successfully created
* **`400` Bad Request** - resource could not be parsed or failed basic FHIR validation rules
* **`409`** **Conflict** - resource with such id already exists
* **`422` Unprocessable Entity** - the proposed resource violated applicable FHIR profiles or server business rules

### update

```http
PUT [base]/[type]/[id]
```

Aidbox doesn't have atomic update yet. It also allows to omit `id` in resource body

* **`200` OK** - resource successfully updated
* **`201` Created** - resource successfully created
* **`422` Unprocessable Entity** - the proposed resource violated applicable FHIR profiles or server business rules

### delete

```
DELETE [base]/[type]/[id]
```

Respond with `200 OK` on successful delete, but on deletion of already deleted resource respond with `204 No Content` \(conforming FHIR specification\). This feature added to make delete work in the same way as SQL `DELETE RETURNING *`.

To get `204 No Content` instead of `200 OK` use `_no-content=true` query parameter. 

* **`200` OK** - resource successfully delete
* **`204` No Content** - resource already deleted
* **`404` Not Found** - resource not found

### conditional create

```
POST [base]/[type]?[search parameters]
```

Instead of using `If-None-Exist` header, Aidbox uses query parameters as in ordinary `read` operation. This done to make all conditional operations to look the same \(use search query parameters\). 

* **No matches**: The server performs a `create` interaction \(Aidbox version of create\)
* **One Match**: The server returns the found resource and `200 OK`
* **Multiple matches**: The server returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error indicating the client's criteria were not selective enough

### conditional update

```
PUT [base]/[type]?[search parameters]
```

In contrast to FHIR, Aidbox conditional update allows to create a resource with specific `id`. `Conditional update` in case of one match ignores id coming in request body, that mean that resource `id` can't be changed by any `update` operation.

* **No matches**: The server performs a `create` interaction \(Aidbox version of create\)
* **One Match**: The server performs the update against the matching resource
* **Multiple matches**: The server returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error indicating the client's criteria were not selective enough

### conditional delete

```text
DELETE [base]/[type]?[search parameters]
```

It's not clear how to perform an ordinary `delete` on no matches, that's why `404 Not Found` will be returned in this case.

* **No matches:** The respond with `404 Not Found`
* **One Match**: The server performs an ordinary `delete` on the matching resource
* **Multiple matches**: Servers respond with `412 Precondition Failed` error indicating the client's criteria were not selective enough
