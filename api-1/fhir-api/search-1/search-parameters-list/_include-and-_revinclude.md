# \_include, \_revinclude, \_with

## Configuration

### Include Conformant Mode

Since 2402, Aidbox has a FHIR-compliant behavior for `_include` and `_revinclude` parameters. It is recommended to turn it on.

To toggle on:

```
BOX_SEARCH_INCLUDE_CONFORMANT=true
```

Also, there's a way to set the maximum number of iterations for `:iterate` modifier:

<pre><code><strong>BOX_SEARCH_INCLUDE_ITERATE__MAX=5
</strong></code></pre>

#### Differences between FHIR-conformant and Aidbox mode

Due to historical reasons Aidbox treats the `_include` and `_revinclude` parameters slightly differently from the behavior described in the specification (without FHIR-conformant mode on).

1. The `_(rev)include` search parameter without the `:iterate` or `:recurse` modifier should only be applied to the initial ("matched") result. However, in Aidbox mode, it is also applied to the previous \_(rev)include.
2. The \_(rev)include parameter with the :iterate(:recurse) modifier should be repeatedly applied to the result with included resources. However, in Aidbox mode, it only resolves cyclic references.
3. In Aidbox mode, it is possible to search without specifying source type: `GET /Patient?_include=general-practitioner`, but in the FHIR-conformant mode it is not possible.&#x20;

### Authorize Inline Requests Mode

Aidbox provides access control for inline requests (`_include` & `_revinclude`) to ensure users can only retrieve resources they are authorized to view. When a search request contains an inline query, Aidbox verifies access by performing an authorization check against a search query for the included resource. If the requesting user lacks the necessary access rights to the included resource, the entire request is denied with a `403` status.\
\
To enable access control for inline requests, set the following environment variable:

{% code title=".env" %}
```
BOX_SEARCH_AUTHORIZE_INLINE_REQUESTS=true
```
{% endcode %}

#### AccessPolicy Examples with Authorize Inline Requests Mode

Below are examples of AccessPolicy configurations that allow requests such as:

```
/fhir/Patient?_include=Patient:organization
```

With this AccessPolicy, the user can use any `_include` parameters that result in Organization resources being included. However, the query will be rejected if it attempts to include any other resource types.

```yaml
  operation:
    id: "FhirSearch"
  params:
    resource/type: "Patient"
  user:
    id: "my-user-1"
    resourceType: "User"

  operation:
    id: "FhirSearch"
  params:
    resource/type: "Organization"
  user:
    id: "my-user-1"
    resourceType: "User"
```

#### AccessPolicy Examples without Authorize Inline Requests Mode

If this mode is not enabled, you must define the specific \_include or \_revinclude parameters allowed in an AccessPolicy, as shown in the example below. However, this method can be inflexible, and we recommend using **Authorize Inline Requests Mode** in most cases.

```yaml
  operation:
    id: "FhirSearch"
  params:
    resource/type: "Patient"
    _include: "Patient:organization"
  user:
    id: "my-user-1"
    resourceType: "User"
```

## \_include

Syntax for the \_include search parameter:

```yaml
 _include(:reverse|:iterate|:logical)=source-type:search-param:(:target-type)
```

Here **search-param** is a name of the search parameter with the type `reference` defined for **source-type**.

This query can be interpreted in the following manner. For the **source-type** resources in the result include all **target-type resources,** which are referenced by the **search-param**.

**target-type** is optional for not chained includes and means all referenced resource-types:

```yaml
GET /Encounter?_include=Encounter:subject 
=> GET /Encounter?_include=Encounter:subject:*
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
For more explicit interpretation and for performance reason, client must provide target-type for chained includes!
{% endhint %}

### **\_include=\***

You can include all resources referenced from the search result using **\*.** This is considered _bad practice_ because it's too implicit.&#x20;

This feature is only implemented for conformance with the FHIR specification.

&#x20;**Please avoid using it!**

```javascript
GET /Encounter?_include=*
GET /Encounter?_include=Encounter:*
```

## **\_revinclude**

Syntax for **revinclude:**

```
_revinclude(:reverse|:iterate|:logical)=source-type:search-param(:target-type)
```

Interpretation: include all **source-type** resources, which refer **target-type** resources by **search-param** in the result set.

### Chained (rev)includes

Client can chain (rev)includes to load next level of references. (Rev)includes should go in a proper loading order. According to the FHIR specification, for chained includes a client must specify the `:iterate` modifier. However, in Aidbox mode this modifier is **optional**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Client must always specify **target-type** and **source-type** for intermediate (rev)includes because this is explicit and allows Aidbox to prepare dependency graph before query!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Here is the [discussion](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers/topic/About.20\_include.3Aiterate) in the FHIR chat about the `:iterate` ambiguity. We appreciate your opinion!

### Recursive (rev)includes

For self-referencing resources, you can specify the `:recurse` or `:iterate` modifier with **source-type=target-type** to recursively get all children or parents:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="GET" %}
```yaml
GET /Observation?_include:recurse=Observation:has-member
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="PUT Obs1" %}

```
put /Organization/org-456

name: Blackwood Hospital Department Facility Room 1
partOf:
  resourceType: Organization
  id: org-345
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### (rev)include and \_elements

You can use the extended [elements](\_elements.md) parameter to control elements of (rev)included resources by prefixing desired elements with the resource type:

```yaml
GET /Encounter?_include=patient&_elements=id,status,Patient.name,Patient.birthDate
```

## :logical modifier

If you provide `:logical` modifier, Aidbox will include logically referenced resources as well. Logical reference means reference with attribute `type` set to resource-type and `identifier` attribute set to one of identifier of referenced resource.&#x20;

Example:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="GET" %}
```markup
GET /Encounter?_include:logical=Encounter:patient
```

```yaml
GET /Encounter?_with=patient:logical
```

```yaml
GET /Patient?_revinclude:logical=Encounter:patient:Patient
```

```yaml
GET /Patient?_with=Encounter.patient:logical
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="PUT Patient" %}
```yaml
PUT /Patient

resourceType: Patient
id: pat-123
identifier:
- {system: 'ssn', value: '78787878'}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="PUT Encounter" %}
```yaml
PUT /Encounter

resourceType: Encounter
id: enc-123
subject: 
  type: Patient
  identifier: {system: 'ssn', value: '78787878'}
class: {code: 'IMP', 
  system: 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode', 
  display: 'inpatient encounter'}
status: finished
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Using the \_with parameter

FHIR (rev)include syntax is non-DRY and sometimes confusing. We introduced the `_with` parameter that is a simple (like GraphQL) DSL to describe includes in a more compact way.

```javascript
expr = param-expr (space param-expr)*
param-expr = param  ( '{' typed-ref-expr (space typed-ref-expr)* '}')?
typed-ref-expr = resource-type | resource-type '{' expr '}'
param = resource-type '.' param-name  (':recur' | ':logical') ? | param-name (':recur' | ':logical') ?
space = ',' | ' ' | '\n'
param-name = ALPAHNUM
```

Examples:

```yaml
Encounter?_with=patient
=> Encounter?_include=Encounter:patient
---
Encounter?_with=patient,participant
=> Encounter?_include=Encounter:patient,Encounter:participant
---
Encounter?_with=patient{Patient}
=> Encounter?_include=Encounter:patient:Patient
---
Encounter?_with=patient{Patient{organization}}
=> Encounter?_include=Encounter:patient:Patient&
             _include(:iterate)=Patient:organization
---            
Encounter?_with=patient{Patient{organization{Organization{partof:recur}}}}
=> Encounter?_include=Encounter:patient:Patient&
             _include(:iterate)=Patient:organization
             _include(:recurse)=Organization:parto-of           
---             
Patient?_with=organization,Condition.patient,MedicationStatement.patient{medication}
=> Patient?_include=Patient:organization&
           _revinclude=Condition:patient:Patient
           _revinclude=MedicationStatement:patient:Patient
           _include=MedicationStatement:medication
---             
RequestGroup?_with=
 author
 patient{Patient{organization,AllergyIntolerance.patient}}
 target{
  MedicationRequest{
    medication
    intended-performer{Organization}
    requester{PractitionerRole{practitioner,location}}}}
=>
RequestGroup?_include=patient,author
    &_include:iterate=RequestGroup:target:MedicationRequest
    &_include:iterate=MedicationRequest:medication
    &_include:iterate=MedicationRequest:requester:PractitionerRole
    &_include:iterate=MedicationRequest:intended-performer:Organization
    &_include:iterate=PractitionerRole:practitioner
    &_include:iterate=Patient:organization
    &_include:iterate=PractitionerRole:location
    &_revinclude:iterate=AllergyIntolerance:patient
 ---

```
