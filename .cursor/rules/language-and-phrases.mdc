# Language and Phrases for Technical Documentation

## Common Phrases and Transitions

### Opening Phrases
- "This section explains..."
- "The following approach..."
- "To implement this feature..."
- "This design addresses..."
- "The limitation of this approach is..."

### Transitional Phrases
- "So how do you actually..."
- "But what if..."
- "This works great, but..."
- "Similarly..."
- "On top of that..."

### Concluding Phrases
- "The key benefit is..."
- "This approach provides..."
- "Best practice recommends..."
- "Performance testing confirms..."

## Technical Explanations

### Show, Don't Just Tell
When explaining concepts:
1. State the principle briefly
2. Show a bad example
3. Show a good example
4. Explain the difference

### Explain the "Why"
Always connect technical decisions to user experience:

**Example:**
❌ "Use HSL color format."
✅ "Hex and RGB are the most common formats for representing color on the web, but they're not the most useful. HSL fixes this by representing colors using attributes the human-eye intuitively perceives..."

## Writing Don'ts

### Avoid Academic Language
- No passive voice when active works better
- No unnecessarily complex vocabulary
- No lengthy theoretical explanations
- No "**Something**: some text" templates

### Don't Over-Explain
- Trust the reader's intelligence
- Let examples do the heavy lifting
- Keep explanations concise
- Focus on overview, not tutorials

### Avoid Absolutism
Use qualifying language appropriately:
- "often" instead of "always"
- "usually" instead of "must"
- "might want to" instead of "should"
