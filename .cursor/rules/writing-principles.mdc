# Core Writing Principles for Technical Documentation

## Problem-First Approach
Always start with the problem or pain point before introducing solutions. Present challenges clearly and directly using relatable scenarios that readers can visualize.

**Example:**
❌ "Visual hierarchy is the arrangement of elements in order of importance..."
✅ "Complex data models stored in relational databases require extensive normalization and multiple joins, making queries slow and maintenance difficult."

## Professional Clarity
Write in direct, professional tone that respects reader expertise. Avoid overly casual language while maintaining clarity. Use contractions for conversational flow.

**Good phrases:**
- "This approach provides..."
- "The implementation uses..."
- "This design enables..."
- "Consider the following scenario..."

## Concrete Examples Over Abstract Concepts
Ground concepts in real-world scenarios. Use specific, actionable examples. Avoid theoretical explanations without practical context.

**Example:**
❌ "Implement proper spacing in your interface."
✅ "For example, say you're building a flight booking service. You could start with a feature like 'searching for a flight'."

## Technical Precision
- Use precise technical language that accurately describes concepts
- When introducing new terms, provide brief explanations
- Use `code` highlighting for technical terms, operations, and file names
- Reference FHIR specification when implementing FHIR features

**Examples:**
- "Schema-less storage for evolving data models"
- "Binary JSON for efficient querying"
- "The `$validate` operation checks resource compliance"
- "FHIR `Bundle` resources for batch operations"

## Strategic Emphasis
- **Bold** for introducing new concepts or key takeaways
- *Italics* sparingly for subtle emphasis
- • Bullet points for actionable lists
- Avoid excessive formatting

## Specific Numbers and Measurements
Be precise with measurements and values:
- "16px is a great number to start with..."
- "jumping from 12px to 16px is an increase of 33%"
- "you want 8-10 shades to choose from"
