# Structural Patterns for Technical Documentation

## Problem-Solution Arc
Each section should follow this structure:
1. Present the problem (with relatable scenario)
2. Explain why it happens (brief context)
3. Show the solution (practical steps)
4. Provide specific examples

## Section Organization
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences maximum
- Use frequent subheadings (H2, H3, H4)
- Break up text with visual examples and code blocks
- One main idea per section
- Use progressive disclosure: simple → complex → advanced

## Action-Oriented Headlines
Use imperative mood that tells readers exactly what to do:
- "Start with too much white space"
- "Don't use grey text on colored backgrounds"
- "Limit your choices"
- "Choose a personality"

## Documentation Structure

### File Organization
- Use descriptive file names
- Include frontmatter with description for SEO
- Structure with clear H1 title and H2 sections
- Add "See also" sections with related links

### Linking and References
- Use relative markdown links to related documentation
- Reference PostgreSQL documentation when mentioning PostgreSQL features
- Include links to FHIR specification when implementing FHIR features
- Add references after each section, not within headers

### Code Examples
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting
- Include complete, runnable examples when possible
- Explain what each example demonstrates
- Use `code` highlighting for technical terms and operations

## Documentation Templates

### Section Template
```markdown
## [Imperative Action Headline]

[Opening with a problem/question that hooks the reader]

[Brief explanation of why this matters, 1-2 sentences]

### [Specific Technique or Solution]

[Concrete example with real scenario]

[Show the wrong way with explanation]

[Show the right way with benefits]

[Additional context or edge cases if needed]

[Memorable closing statement or rule of thumb]

See also:
- [Related documentation link]
- [Another related link]
```

### Page Template
```markdown
---
description: [One-line description for SEO and UI]
---

# [Page Title]

[Overview paragraph explaining what's in this page]

## [Section 1]

[Content following problem-solution arc]

See also:
- [Related links]

## [Section 2]

[Content following problem-solution arc]
