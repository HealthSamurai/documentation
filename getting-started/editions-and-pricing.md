# Licensing and Support

Aidbox offers developers a smooth path from a tiny digital health app prototype to a country-wide deployment of a global healthcare solution. [Health Samurai](https://www.health-samurai.io/) is always around to ensure developers get all the necessary support.

## Aidbox license types:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="447"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Aidbox Edition</strong></td><td><strong>Price</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Aidbox production license</td><td>$</td></tr><tr><td>Development license </td><td>free</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Production license

A production license allows running Aidbox for 14 days (trial) and then can be extended by the Health Samurai team for production usage with PHI data. Please [contact us](../contact-us.md) for more details.

### Development license

The Aidbox development license is intended exclusively for development, testing, and demonstration purposes. This license comes with specific restrictions and limitations:\
\
\- **No PHI:** Users must not load real healthcare data or Protected Health Information (PHI) into any Aidbox instance operating under a Development license.\
\
\- **Storage Limit**: The Development license permits storage of up to 5 GB of data in your database.

When you reach your database size limit, you’ll receive 3 types of messages - warning, error message, and blocking message:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Warning" %}
`Your database (name of your database) size 4.9 GiB is about to exceed the license limit 5.0 GiB, in that case your process is going to shutdown. Please review database size or contact us for further information.`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Error" %}
`Your database (name of your database) size is 5.7 GiB and it's above license limit 5.0 GiB. Please review database size or contact us for further information.`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Blocking" %}
`Your database (name of your database) size is 33.7 GiB and it's above license limit 5.0 GiB, your process is going to shutdown in 60 minutes. Please review database size or contact us for further information.`
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
