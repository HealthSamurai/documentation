## July 2021 - v:2107

* We've released a major Aidbox UI upgrade

![New Aidbox UI](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (49) (7) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (12) (1) (10) (10) (1) (11) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (11) (6).png>)

* Updated REST Console (check out[ the tutorial](https://bit.ly/rest\_console\_tutorial)):
  * Explicit request headers `content-type, accept` etc
  * Show raw response
  * Added syntax highlight
* Upgrade Aidbox Java version to 16.
* Added `user.email`, `user.name` to the User grid to improve UX. [#397](https://github.com/Aidbox/Issues/issues/397).
* Improved logging.
  * Reviewed and updated log event schema. The updated schema is available [here](https://docs.aidbox.app/core-modules/logging-and-audit#logs-schema).
  * Add w\_r - templated request URL for better aggregation. For example, requests like `GET /Patient/pt-1` will become `GET /Patient/?` thus allowing aggregate all read requests for monitoring.
  * Log additional DB metrics from Aidbox.Dev.
  * Added ELK, Kibana, and Grafana to Aidbox image. So now you can start exploring and analyzing logs from scratch. Check our tutorial on exploring and visualizing logs [here](https://docs.aidbox.app/app-development-guides/tutorials/how-to-explore-and-visualize-aidbox-logs-with-kibana-and-grafana).
* We added a new auth mechanism for authorization Aidbox.Cloud and Aidbox.Multibox users by JWT.

You can use **/\[resourceType]/$dump-csv** endpoint to generate CSV file in which JSON resource structure is flattened into comma-separated format. Such an option for data export is useful for integrations with external EHR systems.
* Added support for [If-Match header](https://docs.aidbox.app/api-1/api/crud-1/delete) in DELETE operation of FHIR REST API. If-Match is most often used to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user agents might be acting in parallel on the same resource (i.e., to prevent the "lost update" problem).
* Added support for additional mime types according to the [FHIR specification](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#mime-type) Accept: _application/fhir+json_, Accept: _application/json+fhir._ When one of the headers is specified for your request, the same Content-Type header is returned by Aidbox.
* Implemented integration with [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). Datadog offers cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform which integrates and automates infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, and log management for real-time observability of customers. You can [configure it](https://docs.aidbox.app/app-development-guides/receive-logs-from-your-app/aidbox-logs-and-datadog-integration) as storage for Aidbox logs. The detailed guide on how to use Datadog monitoring capabilities in your Aidbox-based system you can find [here. ](https://docs.aidbox.app/app-development-guides/receive-logs-from-your-app/datadog-guide)This is an easy way to leverage HIPAA-compliant log management SaaS platform to unify logs, metrics, and traces in a single view.
* Logs that are published on Aidbox startup are cleaned up from useless data.
* SSL connection between Aidbox and PostgreSQL is now supported. Please, read the [configuration instructions](https://docs.aidbox.app/getting-started/installation/use-devbox-aidbox#configuring-ssl-connection-with-postgresql) for more details.
* Fixed a bug with race condition occurring during CRUD operations with If-Match header. Transaction rollback is implemented for the case when concurrent change happens to the resource.
* Fixed a bug in the user management module when a second registration for a deleted user resulted in an error.
