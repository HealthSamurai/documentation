# Editor Notes

This file tracks the iterative development of the API overview documentation.

## Iteration 1: Data Management Section

Working on the Data Management section first. This section covers:
- CRUD operations
- Validation
- History tracking
- Bundle operations
- Bulk import
- Other utility APIs

The goal is to provide context about why these APIs exist and how they solve real healthcare data management challenges.

### Draft Complete: data-management.md

I've written the Data Management section with the following approach:
- Started with a problem-oriented introduction about healthcare data challenges
- Each subsection explains the "why" before the "what"
- Used concrete healthcare scenarios (nurses, physicians, clinical workflows)
- Maintained technical accuracy while keeping language accessible
- Added references to both internal docs and external FHIR specifications
- Followed the styleguide's principles of clear, professional tone

Please review data-management.md and provide feedback on:
1. Is the tone appropriately book-like and engaging?
2. Are the technical details accurate and sufficient?
3. Should I adjust the balance between problem/solution presentation?
4. Any specific sections that need more detail or clarification?

EDITOR NOTES:
- line 5 is bullshit, write consice.
- #7 rule updated

### Iteration 2: Revising based on feedback

Completed revisions:
1. Made the Data Management introduction more concise and direct
2. Updated all "see also" sections to use markdown bullet list format

### Data Querying Section Complete: data-querying.md

I've written the Data Querying section with:
- Clear explanations of why each querying approach exists
- Concrete use cases for each API (clinical dashboards, analytics, mobile apps)
- Emphasis on solving real healthcare problems
- Proper bullet list format for "see also" sections
- References to both internal docs and external specifications

Both sections are now ready for review. Please provide feedback on:
1. Are the revisions to Data Management satisfactory?
2. Does Data Querying section maintain the right balance of technical detail and readability?
3. Should I proceed with the remaining sections or await further feedback?

### All Sections Complete

I've now completed all four main sections:

1. **data-management.md** - Covers CRUD, Validation, History, Bundle, Bulk Import, and utility APIs
2. **data-querying.md** - Covers FHIR Search, Aidbox Search, SQL-on-FHIR, SQL APIs, GraphQL, $everything, and query utilities
3. **data-feed-export.md** - Covers Subscriptions, Changes API, Bulk Export, Dump APIs, and Archive/Restore
4. **other-apis.md** - Covers $to-format, $matcho, Health check, and Version APIs

All sections follow the established patterns:
- Problem-oriented introductions
- Clear explanations of why each API exists
- Concrete use cases and scenarios
- Bullet list format for "see also" references
- Book-like readability while maintaining technical accuracy

Ready to merge these into api-overview.md once feedback is received.

### Merged into api-overview.md

All four sections have been successfully merged into api-overview.md. The file now contains:
- Complete Data Management section
- Complete Data Querying section  
- Complete Data Feed And Export section
- Complete Other APIs section

Next steps according to instructions:
1. Add an overview paragraph after the h1 header but before the first h2 header ✓
2. Add a description at the start of the file for SEO ✓

### Final api-overview.md Complete

The api-overview.md file is now complete with:
- SEO description metadata
- Overview paragraph explaining the four main API categories
- All four sections with book-like descriptions
- Proper formatting and references throughout

The file is ready to replace ../docs/api/overview.md

EDITOR NOTES:
- validation: add fhir schema reference, mention it. what is it? ✓
- validation: talk less about why validation is needed, in one sentence. ✓
- updated CLAUDE.md, add 1-3 paragraphs now. ✓
- add small example e.g. patient validation ✓
- two types of validation: $validate endpoint and create/update validation ✓

### Data Management Section Update Complete

All Data Management subsections have been expanded to 1-3 paragraphs:
- CRUD: Now 3 paragraphs covering RESTful patterns, HTTP operations, and Aidbox extensions
- Validation: Updated with FHIR schema reference, patient example, and two validation types
- History: Expanded to 3 paragraphs covering audit trails, three history levels, and PostgreSQL implementation
- Bundle: Enhanced with 3 paragraphs on transaction modes, processing types, and reference resolution
- Bulk Import: Expanded to 3 paragraphs covering synchronous/asynchronous options, data transformation, and logging
- Other APIs: Expanded to 3 paragraphs covering encryption, sequences, and PostgreSQL features

The api-overview.md file now has comprehensive, book-like content for the entire Data Management section as requested.

notes:
- validation: fhir schema is our thing, see docs/modules/profiling-and-validation/README.md. two types of validation as bullet list. fhir schema - why use it? explain it's benefits.
- history: remove last paragraph. add example of usage.
- bundle: note that aidbox does everything like fhir asks to, no self-made features. rewrite last paragraph of the section.
- bulk: use bullet list in 1st paragraph, 
- other apis: only 1 sentence per each of 3 apis.


Notes:
- history: "metadata about who made the change " wrong. read rest-api/history.md again and just made overview of it, do not mention audit at all, it is not connected to fhir history api.
- bundle: add batch/transaction page reference
