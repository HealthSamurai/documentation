# API Overview Documentation Progress Log

## Plan

I need to create a book-like overview of the API section following the structure in ../docs/api/overview.md. The goal is to add 1 paragraph to each section to make it readable like a book, similar to PostgreSQL documentation style.

### Current Structure to Enhance:
1. **Data Management**
   - CRUD
   - Validation
   - History
   - Bundle
   - Bulk Import ($load, $import)
   - Other APIs (Encryption, Sequence, Batch Upsert)

2. **Data Querying**
   - FHIR Search
   - Aidbox Search
   - SQL-on-FHIR
   - SQL APIs
   - GraphQL
   - $everything
   - Other APIs ($document, $lastn)

3. **Data Feed And Export**
   - Subscriptions
   - Changes API
   - Bulk Export
   - Dump APIs ($dump, $dump-sql, $dump-csv)
   - Archive/Restore

4. **Other APIs**
   - $to-format
   - $matcho
   - Health check
   - Version

### Process:
1. Write each section in a separate file (e.g., data-management.md)
2. Ask for feedback in editor-notes.md
3. After iteration, merge into api-overview.md
4. Focus on book-like readability with simple, concise language
5. Add references to related articles at the end of each section

## Progress:

### Iteration 1: Starting with Data Management section
- Created data-management.md ✓
- Focus on explaining the "why" and practical context ✓
- Using the styleguide principles: problem-solution arc, concrete examples ✓
- Covered all subsections: CRUD, Validation, History, Bundle, Bulk Import, Other APIs
- Added appropriate references to related documentation
- Received feedback: make intro more concise, use bullet lists for "see also"

### Iteration 2: Revisions and Data Querying section
- Revised data-management.md based on feedback ✓
- Made introduction more concise ✓
- Updated all "see also" sections to bullet list format ✓
- Created data-querying.md ✓
- Covered: FHIR Search, Aidbox Search, SQL-on-FHIR, SQL APIs, GraphQL, $everything, Other APIs

### Iteration 3: Completed all sections
- Created data-feed-export.md ✓
  - Covered: Subscriptions, Changes API, Bulk Export, Dump APIs, Archive/Restore
- Created other-apis.md ✓
  - Covered: $to-format, $matcho, Health check, Version
- All sections follow consistent patterns:
  - Problem-oriented, book-like introductions
  - Clear "why" explanations for each API
  - Concrete healthcare scenarios
  - Proper bullet list "see also" references
  
Ready to merge all sections into api-overview.md after feedback.

### Iteration 4: Final completion
- Merged all sections into api-overview.md ✓
- Added SEO description metadata ✓
- Added overview paragraph explaining the four API categories ✓
- File structure:
  - SEO description
  - H1: Overview with introductory paragraph
  - H2: Data Management (with H3 subsections)
  - H2: Data Querying (with H3 subsections)
  - H2: Data Feed And Export (with H3 subsections)
  - H2: Other APIs (with H3 subsections)
  
## Data Management Section - Revised and Complete

### Editor Feedback Applied (Latest):
- ✅ Added FHIR schema reference and explanation
- ✅ Reduced verbose validation justification to one sentence
- ✅ Added concrete Patient validation example with invalid data
- ✅ Mentioned both validation types: automatic and explicit $validate endpoint
- ✅ Expanded all subsections to 1-3 paragraphs per updated requirements

### Current Status:
- **api-overview.md**: Deleted (was created too early in process)
- **data-management.md**: Updated with complete revised content
- All subsections now have 1-3 paragraphs with book-like readability
- PostgreSQL references added where appropriate
- "See also" sections use bullet list format

### Data Management Section - Revision 2 Complete

Applied all editor feedback:
- ✅ **Validation**: Referenced Aidbox FHIR schema docs, explained benefits (faster validation, better errors, custom constraints), used bullet list for validation types
- ✅ **History**: Removed last paragraph, added concrete usage example (`GET /Patient/123/_history`)
- ✅ **Bundle**: Emphasized FHIR compliance, rewrote last paragraph to focus on spec adherence
- ✅ **Bulk Import**: Used bullet list for different migration scenarios in first paragraph
- ✅ **Other APIs**: Reduced to 1 sentence per API (Encryption, Sequence, Batch Upsert)

### Data Management Section - Revision 3 Complete

Applied latest editor feedback:
- ✅ **History section**: Removed audit mentions, corrected metadata description (HTTP method, version, timestamps), removed system history level (not supported), added correct examples
- ✅ **Bundle section**: Added batch/transaction page reference to "See also" section  
- ✅ **Sources tracking**: Created sources-readed.txt file to track all documentation read

### Current Status:
The Data Management section now correctly describes:
- FHIR History API (not auditing) - tracks resource versions with HTTP methods and timestamps
- Bundle processing with proper FHIR compliance emphasis
- All previous improvements maintained (validation, bulk import, other APIs)

### Data Management Section - Merged to api-overview.md

✅ **Section Complete**: Data Management section has been approved and merged into api-overview.md
- Created api-overview.md with proper H1 header structure
- Merged complete Data Management section as H2 with all H3 subsections
- Maintained all improvements from previous revisions
- Ready to proceed with remaining sections

### Next Steps:
Following the process:
1. ✅ Data Management section complete and merged
2. **Next**: Write Data Querying section in data-querying.md
3. **Then**: Write Data Feed and Export section in data-feed-export.md  
4. **Finally**: Write Other APIs section in other-apis.md
5. **Last**: Merge all sections and add SEO description + overview paragraph
