Want to store images, videos, or documents outside the form? We’ve made it easy. You can now upload files (like videos or images) to an external storage solution, like an S3 bucket, and link them to your form.

Simply set up your storage account and update the [SDCconfig resource](https://www.health-samurai.io/forms-product), and all attachment files will be saved in your designated storage.
