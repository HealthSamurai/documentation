If you are interested in FHIR databases and analytics on FHIR and going to be not far from Baltimore September 29–30 — please join us at the [FHIR Connectathon 19](https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Connectathon_19) and brand new [Storage and Analytics track](https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201809_FHIR_Storage_and_Analytics)!

This track is organized by the group of exceptional engineers from Health Samurai, Cerner, Google, and Athenahealth. We have a long list of hot topics to discuss: SQL on FHIR, storage format, and schemata, how to handle FHIR data in Spark, PostgreSQL, and BigQuery, [FHIRPath](https://www.health-samurai.io/fhirbase) in databases and more. We are working hard on tutorials and assets to let participants touch these things by hands during the connectathon.connectathon.

We also have a couple of interesting cross-track scenarios — use [Bulk API](https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201809_Bulk_Data) to load data into databases and implement quality measures from [Clinical Reasoning track](https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201809_Clinical_Reasoning) in SQL.

Join us in [FHIR chat](https://chat.fhir.org/login/#narrow/stream/73-analytics-on.20FHIR) and see you in Baltimore!
