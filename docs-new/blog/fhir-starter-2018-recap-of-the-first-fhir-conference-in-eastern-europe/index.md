We held [FHIR Starter](https://www.fhirstarter.com/home-english), the first FHIR conference in Eastern Europe on June 25-26 2018. The conference was dedicated to educating attendees about the HL7 FHIR standard, building the implementer community, and coming together to share approaches for international health IT systems design.

FHIR has caught momentum all over the world, and we experienced the passion and curiosity of the 119 participants at the conference for ourselves. People asked thoughtful questions and the conversations were meaningful and engaging. We thank everyone who came to the event for their support of FHIR and look forward to seeing you all again at the next FHIR Starter conference.

We are grateful to the sponsors and partners of the conference: WaveAccess, Robomed Network, EverCare, Netrika, and SPb MIAC. Your support made this event possible.

For those of you who couldn’t attend the conference, we wrote a short recap of the keynotes and shared the links to the presentations and videos in this blog. Video recordings of the conference are available thanks to our partner [EverCare.ru](http://evercare.ru/).

FHIR Starter consisted of two tracks: one with FHIR speaker presentations and another interactive track that served as an introduction to FHIR. We made sure to have content that would be diverse so the conference would be meaningful for both experienced FHIR implementers and anyone who is just beginning to learn about FHIR.

**First FHIR Starter Track - Speaker presentations**

The first track featured 11 speakers who delivered 13 presentations for us. Below are brief summaries of their talks with links to the presentations and videos. The first presentation was a speech from no other than the creator and leader of the international standard HL7 FHIR himself - [Grahame Grieve](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grahame-grieve-952637/). Grahame introduced the audience to FHIR and the FHIR community, and talked about how to work with terminology services.

**Talk #1: Introduction to FHIR and the FHIR Community**

In the first keynote, Grahame Grieve spoke about the history of HL7 standards development, the emergence of the FHIR standard, and emphasized FHIR core principles and the importance and activity of an international HL7 FHIR community. Grahame also talked about one of the most interesting FHIR projects called ‘Argonaut’, and mentioned that HL7 FHIR is already being used by tech giants as Google and Apple. He also encouraged all the attendees to become a part of the growing, global FHIR community where every developer can come to learn, participate and contribute.

**Second FHIR Starter Track: Connectathons, Live Workshops, Discussions**

![](image-3.svg)

The second track of FHIR Starter was themed “Introduction to HL7 FHIR” and ran as an interactive connectathon where attendees had the chance to dive into real live case studies and work through use cases. This was a lively and engaging experience, with many active listeners participating. We were asked great questions about FHIR and shared a meaningful learning experience with the attendees. Over the course of the 2 days, FHIR experts from Health Samurai gave talks, workshops and led discussions on various topics:

- **Overview of Business Logical Resources for HL7 FHIR**
- *Slides (in Russian):* [*http://bit.ly/2lPAK0G*](http://bit.ly/2lPAK0G)
- ***Lecture and workshop on FHIR API (MetaModel, embedded in HL7 FHIR)***

- **Approaches in working with Terminologies**
- *Slides (in English):* [*http://bit.ly/2MHpX4i*](http://bit.ly/2MHpX4i)

As part of the event, a separate discussion group was organized where anyone could write the questions they had on a flipchart for the core FHIR team members Grahame Grieve and Lloyd McKenzie. In between breaks, Grahame and Lloyd answered those questions and engaged in dialogue with everyone interested.
