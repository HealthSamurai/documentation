## ViewDefinition Builder (Analytics on FHIR)

Analyzing FHIR data is crucial for gaining valuable insights that can improve patient care, optimize resource allocation, and enhance operational efficiency. However, FHIR data, stored in JSON format, can be challenging to analyze due to its complex and nested structure. This complexity hinders the ability to extract meaningful insights, leading to missed opportunities for better patient outcomes and operational improvements.

The Public ViewDefinition Builder is a free tool designed to simplify the analysis of FHIR data by converting it into a tabular, flat layout using the ViewDefinition resource. This tool is fully compliant with HL7 FHIR Spec and SQL-on-FHIR IG, ensuring that the converted data is ready for analysis and reporting.

**Key Features:**

- **Easy Data Analysis**: Convert FHIR data into a format suitable for analysis, making it easier to extract insights.
- **Compliance**: Meet HL7 FHIR standards for data conversion, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **Efficiency**: Use pre-configured options for common conversions, saving time and resources.

## CCDA / FHIR Bidirectional Converter

The Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) has been a widely adopted standard for exchanging clinical documents, but it has limitations that make it less suitable for modern digital health needs. FHIR standard, on the contrary, provides a standardized format for data exchange, making it easier to share and analyze data across different healthcare systems, including EHRs, labs, HIEs etc.

The converter offers a seamless and secure way to convert C-CDA to FHIR and vice versa, so that you can easily exchange data between different systems.

**Key features:**

- **Effortless Conversion**: Convert C-CDA to FHIR and FHIR to C-CDA quickly and securely, with pre-configured mapping rules for most C-CDA sections. No sample on hand? Check out our ready-to-use options.
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with industry standards, including the § 170.315(g)(9) ONC criterion for importing and exporting patient data in C-CDA format.
- **Flexibility**: Work [with any FHIR server](https://www.health-samurai.io/fhir-server), and integrate with existing healthcare infrastructure for seamless data exchange
