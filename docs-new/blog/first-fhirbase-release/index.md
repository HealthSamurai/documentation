Health Samurai team is proud to announce the [first stable release of Fhirbase](https://www.health-samurai.io/fhirbase-downloads?utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=fb-release-004&utm_medium=social), an open-source tool to store and manage FHIR data in [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/) relational database.

Using SQL with FHIR data is a hot topic, which gained a lot of attention in the FHIR community. It’s been actively discussed on [Storage and Analytics track](https://medium.com/fhirbase-dojo/fhir-storage-and-analytics-in-baltimore-67d20d9f32e8)during 19th FHIR Connectathon at Baltimore. Amount of interest is not surprising — SQL is a lingua franca for developers, data analytics and users of BI tools. Leveraging it provides a flexible way to transform and measure FHIR data.

Fhirbase by Health Samurai drastically lowers barrier to entry in SQL world with FHIR data. It allows a user to quickly create a database to store resources in and provides functionality to import data from various sources. Fhirbase is [well-documented](https://aidbox.gitbook.io/fhirbase?utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=fb-release-004&utm_medium=social) and has an [online demo](https://fbdemo.aidbox.app/?utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=fb-release-004&utm_medium=social). We even recorded a screencast to show how to install Fhirbase: [Fhirbase Installation Screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rQnF2yGH8Y&t=1s).

We hope that Fhirbase will be useful to solve arising challenges in the FHIR community.
