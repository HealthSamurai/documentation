We’re excited to introduce AI-powered features in [Aidbox Forms](https://www.health-samurai.io/forms-product) that make creating electronic and multilingual medical forms faster and easier. Here’s what’s new:

## **How AI Speeds Up Converting Paper Forms to Digital**

Medical forms often start as standardized paper documents. Instead of manually recreating them, our AI and OCR technology can automatically convert PDFs into structured electronic forms.

How it works:

- Upload a PDF and AI with OCR extracts text and generates a digital form.
- Use [a special endpoint](https://docs.aidbox.app/reference/aidbox-forms/generating-forms-from-pdf) to automate this process.
- Compare a paper and electronic version, or extract parts of a paper form to integrate into an existing one—right inside the builder.

This feature saves time and ensures accuracy when transitioning from paper to digital workflows!

## **How AI Assists in Creating Multilingual Medical Forms**

Supporting multiple languages in medical applications can be challenging. Instead of manually duplicating forms, AI-assisted translation allows you to create a single form in multiple languages effortlessly.

How it works:

- Create a form in the default language.
- Use AI assistance to add translations seamlessly.

With this feature, localization becomes fast, efficient, and accurate, ensuring a smooth experience for users across different languages.
