*Dojo means “place of the Way” in Japanese. It is a space for immersive learning and training.* *We're happy to launch the FHIRbase Dojo, a blog dedicated to helping you use FHIR for storage and analytics.*

### **The FHIRbase Dojo is about using FHIR in databases.**

Please bookmark it: <https://medium.com/fhirbase-dojo>

#### **What are we going to post?**

We’ll write about implementing, storing and analyzing FHIR data with tools such as [FHIRbase](https://www.health-samurai.io/fhirbase), [Bunsen](https://github.com/cerner/bunsen), [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/). We’ll also share the latest news from the “Storage & Analytics” track of [HL7’s FHIR Connectathon](https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Connectathon_19) and other events.

#### **Why was the FHIRbase Dojo Created?**

We hope to create an informational hub to share knowledge and best practices from FHIR experts. We believe this will be interesting for health IT engineers and analytic experts using FHIR.
