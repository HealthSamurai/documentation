# IDP overview

Auditbox supports managing user authentication using third-party
identity providers (IDPs).

With proper configuration, you can often set up Single Sign-On (SSO)
in your identity provider to, for example, login using your Google
account.

By default, Auditbox ships with Keycloak, but long as the identity
provider supports OAuth2 standard, it should be possible to connect.
Unless stated otherwise, configuration assumes Keycloak is set up as
the IDP.
