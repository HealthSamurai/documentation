# Printing forms

When filling out a form, you can print it in its current state at any moment by clicking the Print button in the bottom left corner.
Once you click it, you'll see the default browser print dialog allowing you to save the form as PDF or print it.
The general layout is preserved, but the final look of the form in print or PDF will depend on the options you select in this print dialog (e.g. paper size, margins, background graphics).

Supported browsers: the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.
