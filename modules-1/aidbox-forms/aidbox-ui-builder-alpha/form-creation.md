# Form creation

## UI Builder Interface Overview

When creating a form in the UI builder, the interface includes the following components:

1. &#x20;**Work Area ( left Side ):**
   * Displays the form outline, showing the structure of the form and the properties of the form and its widgets and components.
   * Users can add, remove, or modify form widgets and components.
2. **Form Preview ( right Side ):**
   * Shows the form itself, reflecting changes made in the form outline in real-time.
   * Users can test this form by filling it out directly.
3. **Debug Console ( at the bottom** ) **:**
   * Debug console allows users to view the Questionnaire resource. Each form is presented as a Questionnaire resource and saved in a database.
   * Users can view the QuestionnaireResponse resource. Data from the form is saved in a QuestionnaireResponse resource in a database.
   * Pre-filling the form with existing data is possible for testing purposes on Population tab.
   * Users can view how data will be extracted to other FHIR resources on Extraction tab.
4. **Toolbar ( at the top** )**:**
   * The toolbar contains buttons for various actions.
   * Users can view a preview of the form, set a theme for the form, save the form, and access additional actions.

This interface provides users with the tools needed to create, test, and manage forms effectively.
