# Topic-based subscriptions

Subscriptions enable real-time notifications and updates between servers and clients. This mechanism allows to respond dynamically to changes in patient data or resource states, enhancing the overall efficiency of clinical workflows. \
\
By leveraging the subscriptions, developers can specify criteria for notifications, define delivery channels, and monitor specific events or changes in healthcare data. This push-based approach minimizes the need for constant polling, thereby optimizing resource utilization and improving the timeliness of information dissemination.\
\
Aidbox provides several implementations of Topic-based subscriptions. Dynamic **subscriptions using AidboxSubscriptionTopic** will replace subscriptions using the Aidbox configuration project.
