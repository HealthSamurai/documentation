# The B11 Decision Support Interventions

The B11 criteria from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) replace the previous A9 criteria for clinical decision support in Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.

### Key Changes

1. **AI Integration**: B11 introduces formal requirements for using artificial intelligence in healthcare.
2. **New DSI Types**: It differentiates between evidence-based and predictive decision support interventions.
3. **Enhanced Functionality**: B11 requires improved configuration, triggering, and feedback mechanisms for interventions.
4. **Comprehensive Intervention Info**: EHRs must provide detailed information about each intervention, including its role and performance measures.
5. **Compliance Deadline**: EHRs certified to A9 must transition to B11 by December 31, 2024.

These updates aim to enhance patient safety and support better clinical decision-making. The following sections will detail B11 requirements and how Aidbox can assist in implementation.\
