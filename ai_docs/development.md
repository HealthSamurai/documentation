Development rules:
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. When you change .clj files, to test changes restart the server using `clojure-mcp` in the `user` namespace (see ";; reload server" comment approx line 20).
8. When use styles, always prefer using tailwind classes and tailwind theme, do not use app.css if not necessary
9. Always use sequentialthinking.
10. Make sure you understand what tailwind v4 is and all its differences between v3. Read the doc https://tailwindcss.com/docs.

Used technologies:
