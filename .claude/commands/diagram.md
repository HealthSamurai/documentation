Create mermaid diagram by the user request: $ARGUMENTS.
You MUST copy ALL mermaid styles (classDefs) from @ai_docs/HSMermaidExample.mmd and use them in the diagram.
Always use round rects, for example, "E(Python SDK)".
Write the diagram in the file.
If the diagram already exists, check styles and change if needed.
