# \[WIP] Multibox to Aidbox migration best practices

What changes are coming with migration from Multibox to Aidbox?

We can have a look at different views of migrating from Multibox to Aidbox.

* License
* Infrastructure
* Configuration
* Box behaviour

The main difference between Multibox and Aidbox is that&#x20;

* Multibox enables you to launch multiple virtual boxes in the same runtime with a specified domain `<box_name>.your-domain.com`.
* Aidbox runs only one box in the runtime, so multiple boxes will lead multiple Aidboxes in your infrastructure.

## License

For Multibox you needed one license for instance. And you were be able to launch new boxes from inside Multibox admin portal.
