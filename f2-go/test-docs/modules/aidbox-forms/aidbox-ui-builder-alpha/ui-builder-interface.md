# UI Builder Interface

## UI Builder interface overview

When creating a form in the UI builder, the interface includes the following components:

1. **Work Area ( left Side ):**
   * Displays the form outline, showing the structure of the form and the properties of the form and its widgets and components.
   * Users can add, remove, or modify form widgets and components.
2. **Form Preview ( right Side ):**
   * Shows the form itself, reflecting changes made in the form outline in real-time.
   * Users can test this form by filling it out directly.
3. **Debug Console ( at the bottom** ) **:**
   * Debug console allows users to view the Questionnaire resource. Each form is presented as a Questionnaire resource and saved in a database.
   * Users can view the QuestionnaireResponse resource. Data from the form is saved in a QuestionnaireResponse resource in a database.
   * Pre-filling the form with existing data is possible for testing purposes on Population tab.
   * Users can view how data will be extracted to other FHIR resources on Extraction tab.
   * Named Expressions tab displays all variables that are used in the form.
4. **Toolbar ( at the top** )**:**
   * The toolbar contains buttons for various actions.
   * Users can view a preview of the form, set a theme for the form, save the form, and access additional actions.
   *   The toolbar provides tools to help visualize how your form will be displayed across various devices. You can select one of the **available device options** such as desktop, tablet, or mobile.

       Alternatively, you can manually set the **page width** to preview how the form adapts to different dimensions.

This interface provides users with the tools needed to create, test, and manage forms effectively.
