# Request Interception

## Aidbox Form Builder & Renderer Request Interception

Request interception allows you to modify network requests made by **Aidbox Form Builder** and **Aidbox Form Renderer**. This is useful for debugging, adding authentication, redirecting requests, or handling custom logic before requests are sent.

### Enabling Request Interception

To enable request interception, set the `onFetch` property on the builder or renderer element. This property should be a function that takes two arguments: the URL and the request options. The function should return a promise that resolves to the response.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Builder" %}
```html
<aidbox-form-builder id="aidbox-form-builder" enable-fetch-proxy />

<script>
    const builder = document.getElementById('aidbox-form-builder');
    
    builder.onFetch = async (url, init) => {
        console.log('Intercepted request', url, init);
        return fetch(url, init);
    };
</script>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Renderer" %}
```html
<aidbox-form-renderer id="aidbox-form-renderer" enable-fetch-proxy />

<script>
    const renderer = document.getElementById('aidbox-form-renderer');
    
    renderer.onFetch = async (url, init) => {
        console.log('Intercepted request', url, init);
        return fetch(url, init);
    };
</script>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The interception function must follow the same signature as the standard [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch) function, with the following exceptions:

1. The function can return null or undefined to bypass the interception and allow the builder to handle the request using the standard fetch.
2. The [init object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit) (the second argument) may include an additional tag property. This tag is a string representing the name of one of the [endpoints](request-interception.md#endpoints), allowing you to differentiate between them without relying on the URL or HTTP method, which may be subject to future changes.

### Common Use Cases

These examples demonstrate how to use request interception in various scenarios. Most of the examples are also applicable to the **Renderer** component.

#### 1. Logging Requests

To inspect outgoing requests and responses:

```html
<aidbox-form-renderer id="aidbox-form-renderer" enable-fetch-proxy />

<script>
    const renderer = document.getElementById('aidbox-form-renderer');
    
    renderer.onFetch = async (url, init) => {
        console.log('Request:', url, init);
        const response = await fetch(url, init);
        console.log('Response:', response.status, await response.text());
        return response;
    };
</script>
```

#### 2. Adding Authorization Headers

To include an authorization token in requests:

```html
<aidbox-form-builder id="aidbox-form-builder" enable-fetch-proxy />

<script>
    const builder = document.getElementById('aidbox-form-builder');
    
    builder.onFetch = async (url, init) => {
        const headers = new Headers(init.headers);
        headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`);
        return fetch(url, { ...init, headers });
    };
</script>
```

#### 3. Redirecting Requests

To change the endpoint of requests dynamically:

```html
<aidbox-form-renderer id="aidbox-form-renderer" enable-fetch-proxy />

<script>
    const renderer = document.getElementById('aidbox-form-renderer');
    
    renderer.onFetch = async (url, init) => {
        const newUrl = url.replace('aidbox-instance.com', 'custom-endpoint.com');
        return fetch(newUrl, init);
    };
</script>
```

#### 4. Handling Custom Questionnaire Storage

To store and retrieve forms from local storage:

```html
<aidbox-form-builder form-id="local-questionnaire" id="aidbox-form-builder" enable-fetch-proxy />

<script>
    const builder = document.getElementById('aidbox-form-builder');

    builder.onFetch = async (url, init) => {
        if (init.tag === 'get-questionnaire') {
            const storedForm = localStorage.getItem('local-questionnaire') || '{"resourceType": "Questionnaire", "id": "local-questionnaire"}';
            return new Response(storedForm, { status: 200 });
        }
        if (init.tag === 'save-questionnaire') {
            localStorage.setItem('local-questionnaire', init.body);
            return new Response(init.body, { status: 200 });
        }
        return null;
    };
</script>
```

#### 5. Modifying Extracted Data

To manipulate extraction results before they are processed:

```html
<aidbox-form-builder id="aidbox-form-builder" enable-fetch-proxy />

<script>
    const builder = document.getElementById('aidbox-form-builder');
    
    builder.onFetch = async (url, init) => {
        if (init.tag === 'extract') {
            const response = await fetch(url, init);
            const bundle = await response.clone().json();
            console.log('Extracted Bundle:', bundle);
            return response;
        }
        return null;
    };
</script>
```

## Request Tags

Request tags are used to differentiate between different types of requests. They are passed as a property in the `init` object and can be used to identify the request type in the interception function.
The following tags are available:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Builder" %}

| Tag                                                                                  | When                                                          | Description                                         |

### save-response

Triggered by the auto-save mechanism shortly after the user makes changes in the form.

**Request**

```http
POST /fhir/QuestionnaireResponse/$save HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: appliation/json

    "parameter": [{
        "name": "response",
        "resource": <questionnaire-response>
    }]
}
```

Where `<response>` is the response being submitted.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Status Value**

Since auto-save is only enabled for non-completed forms, the `response` parameter always has the status `in-progress`.
{% endhint %}

**Response**

```json
<parameters>
```

Where `<parameters>` is a [parameters](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/parameters.html) that includes:

* `response`: the saved questionnaire response.
* `issues`: any validation or processing issues, if available.

### submit-response

Triggered when the user submits a response by clicking the submit button. The submit button is displayed when the questionnaire response is either in progress (`in-progress`) or when the user is amending a completed response.

**Request**

```http
POST /fhir/QuestionnaireResponse/$submit HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: appliation/json

{
    "resourceType": "Parameters",
    "parameter": [{
        "name": "response",
        "resource": <questionnaire-response>
    }]
}
```

Where `<response>` is the response being submitted.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Status Value**

The `response` parameter contains the current status, and the Aidbox backend is responsible for transitioning it to the appropriate new state. Therefore, if you need to, for example, intercept an amending submission, you should check for the condition `response.status = 'completed'`.
{% endhint %}

**Response**

```json
<parameters>
```

Where `<parameters>` is a [parameters](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/parameters.html) that includes:
