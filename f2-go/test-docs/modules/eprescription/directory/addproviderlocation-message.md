# AddProviderLocation Message

### Overview

AddProviderLocation is a message type used to add a provider location to the Surescripts directory. This allows providers to register their practice locations for electronic prescribing services.

### How to Send AddProviderLocation Message

To send an AddProviderLocation message, use the following endpoint: `POST /directories/providers`

The required payload is a PractitionerRole identifier.

#### Required FHIR Resources

The following FHIR resources are needed to create an AddProviderLocation message:

1. **PractitionerRole** (Required)
   * Must have valid period dates (if not provided, start defaults to current date and end defaults to 2/31/2099 12:00:00 AM EST)
   * Must have service levels defined in `meta.tag`
   * Must include Practitioner and Location references
   * Links prescriber to their organization/location
2. **Practitioner** (Required)
   * Must have NPI identifier
   * Must NOT have SPI (use [update provider flow](updateproviderlocation-message.md) instead)
   * Must have name
   * Contains prescriber's information
3. **Location** (Required)
   * PractitionerRole can have multiple Locations, so for Location to be selected it's required for it to have a tag with system `urn:app:aidbox:e-prescriptions:surescripts:providerDirectory` (value does not matter)
   * Must have address
   * Must have primary phone number (exactly 10 digits)
   * Must have primary fax number
   * Phone numbers validation rules:
     * Must not be all repeating digits
     * Must not be sequential
     * Must not start with 555
   * Will fallback to PractitionerRole's **Organization**, if not provided and casted to **Location**.
