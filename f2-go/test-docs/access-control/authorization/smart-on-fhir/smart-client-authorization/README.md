# SMART Client Authorization

SMART Defines Two Patterns For Client Authorization:

- [SMART App Launch](./smart-app-launch.md). Authorizes a user-facing app to connect to Aidbox, enabling it to access "launch context" like a selected patient, based on the user's session in an EHR or choice at launch. This also delegates the userâ€™s permissions to the app.

- [SMART Backend services](./smart-backend-services.md). Authorizes a backend service to connect to Aidbox, enabling interaction with an EHR without direct user involvement, using pre-assigned permissions.
