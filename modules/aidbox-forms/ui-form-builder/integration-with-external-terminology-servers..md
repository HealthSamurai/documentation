# Integration with external terminology servers.

Aidbox Forms is integrated with external terminology servers, including TermBox, Public FHIR community server, Ontoserver (CSIRO). We also provide the option to inegrate with any public terminology server or use the current Aidbox instance.&#x20;

This integration allows you to:

* Encode question fields and answer options using selected terminologies.
* Utilize predefined value sets for answers, ensuring consistency and accuracy in data collection.

This functionality enhances the interoperability of your forms by leveraging standardized terminologies, making it easier to maintain and share data across different systems.
