# Tokens processing

### Token types

There are two types of token Aidbox supports:

* `opaque` strings are treaded as is. Aidbox does not parse such tokens and not validate them
* `JWT`s could be parsed and their signature could be checked as well

### Parsing and validating `JWT`

Aidbox parses JWT tokens every time it receives it. Main steps in parsing and validating JWT strings are:

* to check if token string looks like JWT
* to parse string to JWT object
* to check JWT if token is not expired
* to check JWT signature

### Processing access token

`access_token` and `refresh_token` issued by Aidbox are just opaque strings. So Aidbox does not process them.
