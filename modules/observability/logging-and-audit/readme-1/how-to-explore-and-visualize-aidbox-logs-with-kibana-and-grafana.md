# ðŸŽ“ Log analysis and visualization tutorial

## Update Docker Image

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available since [July 2021 - v:2107](https://docs.aidbox.app/getting-started/versioning-and-release-notes/release-notes#july-2021-v-2107-stable) Aidbox version
{% endhint %}

To begin using pre-configured Kibana and Grafana please clone [this repository](https://github.com/Aidbox/devbox) and execute `make up` operation in your shell.

## **Explore logs with Kibana**

To use Kibana you need to understand Aidbox log formatting first. Go to Aidbox log documentation ([Logging & Audit](https://docs.aidbox.app/core-modules/logging-and-audit)) to find logs schema available here with a brief attribute description.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aidbox/devbox.git
cd devbox
make up
```

## **Explore logs with Kibana**

To get a deeper understanding of Aidbox logs please go to the [log documentation](https://docs.aidbox.app/core-modules/logging-and-audit) and explore logs schema available there.

{% hint style="info" %}
Aidbox Elastic appender sends logs as bundles of multiple records so if there's not enough data **you won't see any logs in Kibana**. For testing purposes reduce bundle size to 1 record by setting environment variable:

```yaml
AIDBOX_ES_BATCH_SIZE=1
```

Aidbox Elastic appender documentation is available [here](../how-to-guides/elastic-logs-and-monitoring-integration.md#elasticsearch-logging).
{% endhint %}

Using the listed attributes helps you to read REST logs in Elastic search filtering them type by type.

The example below will help you read REST API logs:

Please put + to toggle `Time`, `w_m`, `w_r`_,_`w_url`, `d`, `w_st`, `w_uid` fields into the document table:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (41) (1) (1).png>)

Now you can browse and explore REST API logs

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>)

_Kibana's **Discover** enables you to quickly search and filter your data, get information about the structure of the fields, and visualize your data with **Lens** and **Maps**. You can customize and save your searches and place them on a dashboard._

Check [Kibana documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/discover.html) for additional info or [let us know](https://t.me/aidbox) if you need help.

## **Visualize logs with Grafana**

We've built a custom Grafana dashboard available by default where you can see basic metrics.

The pre-configured views are the following:

1. Requests per minute.
2. Request duration heatmap.
3. Number of requests per day.
4. Request Methods.
5. Errors.
6. Mean request http/db.
7. Response time.
8. Slow queries.
9. Users/Clients online.

You can update the default dashboard with your own custom views. For more info please refer to [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/tutorials/grafana-fundamentals/).
