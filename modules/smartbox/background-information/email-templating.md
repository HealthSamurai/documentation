# Email templating

Emails are sent using Notification and NotificationTemplate resources. See more:

{% content-ref url="../../integration-toolkit/email-providers/" %}
[email-providers](../../integration-toolkit/email-providers/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The full list of available templates and their dynamic values can be found [here](../how-to-guides/set-up-ehr-level-customization.md).
