# Local IG Package

Aidbox allows you to upload a package from your computer even in offline mode. The file must be in **.targz** format.&#x20;

If the package includes dependencies, they can either be included in the upload or automatically downloaded from the Aidbox Registry when online.

## 1. Run Aidbox with FHIR Schema Validation Engine

{% content-ref url="../../setup.md" %}
[setup.md](../../setup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## 2. Open the Aidbox UI

1. Navigate to the **FHIR Packages** page.
2. Go to the **Import FHIR Package** sidebar section.
3. Click the "**Choose files"** button in the "**Upload package .targz files**" section.
4. Click **Submit** button.
