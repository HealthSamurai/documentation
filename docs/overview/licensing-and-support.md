# Licensing and Support

Aidbox offers developers a smooth path from a tiny digital health app prototype to a country-wide deployment of a global healthcare solution. [Health Samurai](https://www.health-samurai.io/) is always around to ensure developers get all the necessary support.

### Production license

A production license allows running Aidbox for 14 days (trial) and then can be extended by the Health Samurai team for production usage with PHI data. Please [contact us](contact-us.md) for more details.

### Development license

The Aidbox development license is intended exclusively for development, testing, and demonstration purposes. This license comes with specific restrictions and limitations:\
\
\- **No PHI:** Users must not load real healthcare data or Protected Health Information (PHI) into any Aidbox instance operating under a Development license.\
\
\- **Storage Limit**: The Development license permits storage of up to 5 GB of data in your database.

When you reach your database size limit, you’ll receive 2 types of warnings:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="About to exceed the license limit" %}
`Your database (name of your database) size 4.9 GiB is about to exceed the license limit 5.0 GiB. Please review database size or contact us for further information.`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Above license limit" %}
`Your database (name of your database) size is 5.7 GiB and it's above license limit 5.0 GiB. Please review database size or contact us for further information.`
{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}
