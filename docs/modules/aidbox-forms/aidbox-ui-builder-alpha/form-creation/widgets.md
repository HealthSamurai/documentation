# Widgets

Aidbox Forms provides a set of widgets that allow you to build comprehensive and user-friendly medical forms. Widgets are pre-defined elements that you can add to your forms to capture various types of data from users.

This section details the various widgets available in Aidbox Forms and their corresponding settings.

## Common Widget’s Settings

In the widget settings, you can define various parameters that determine its appearance and behavior.

The user has the ability to change the widget type by clicking on the "change type" button in the upper right corner of the widget settings sidebar, while some of the settings for the current widget that the user entered will be saved, and some will need to be re-set.

Here are the main settings you can configure for most widgets.

### General section

#### LinkId

An identifier that is unique within the Questionnaire allowing linkage to the equivalent item in a QuestionnaireResponse resource.

It is generated automatically, but the user can change it.

#### System / Code / Display

The user can manually add several codes from different terminology systems (use 'add code' option). Or import this data from terminologies (use 'import code' option).

`Code` - a terminology code that corresponds to this group or question (e.g. a code from LOINC, which defines many questions and answers).

`System` - identity of the terminology system.

`Display` - representation defined by the system

#### Text

The Text field is used to define content for sections, questions, or display items within a form.

#### **Short Text**

The Short Text field provides an alternative, abbreviated version of the text. It is particularly useful when rendering forms on smaller screens, such as mobile devices, where space is limited.

#### Size

The Size parameter allows user to define the width of a widget and arrange multiple widgets horizontally within a form.

* The form layout is based on a 12-column grid system.
* By setting the size of a widget:
  * Maximum Size (12 columns): The widget will span the entire width of the form (by default)
  * Partial Size:
    * If one widget is set to a width of 6 columns and another to 6 columns, both widgets will be displayed side by side on the same line.
    * Similarly, setting widths like 4, 4, and 4 will arrange three widgets horizontally in a row.

#### Hidden, Required, Read Only, and Repeats Settings

* `Hidden:` Hides the form item from user view while still allowing it to be used internally or for conditional logic.
* `Required:` Ensures the user must provide input for the item before submitting the form.
* `Read Only:` Displays the form item as non-editable, allowing users to view but not modify its value.
* `Repeats:` Enables the user to dynamically add multiple instances of the same form item as needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
`Repeats` for Checkbox-list and Choice widgets have different behavior! When `Repeats` are enabled, it makes it possible to perform multi-choice actions within the widget.
{% endhint %}

#### Collapsible

Collapsible section is supported to enhance the usability and navigation of long questionnaires. This feature allows the child items of a group or question item to be displayed in a collapsible form, letting users toggle between showing and hiding nested items.

There are options:

1. `Not Collapsible`: The section is always fully expanded, and its child items are visible.
2. `Collapsible (Open by Default)`: The section is collapsible and starts in an expanded state. Users can collapse it if desired.
3. `Collapsible (Closed by Default)`: The section is collapsible and starts in a collapsed state. Users can expand it to view the child items.

User can set the desired collapsibility option for specific sections or items within the questionnaire.

### Media section

#### **Image & Video**

Allows you to add an image or video next to a form item, enhancing its visual appeal or providing additional context. The user needs to provide a publicly available URL for the image or video.

#### **Tooltip**

Displays additional information when the user clicks the question mark icon in the top-right corner of a field, offering guidance or clarification.

#### Support Link

The Support Link option allows you to associate an external or internal link with a question, group, or display item within a form. This is particularly useful for providing users with additional descriptive details or reference material.

* When a support link is added, an **icon** appears immediately.
* Users can click on the icon to navigate to the linked resource, typically displayed in a separate page or browser tab.

Use Cases:

* Providing contextual help or instructions for complex questions.
* Linking to guidelines, manuals, or regulatory references.
* Adding reference material for specific sections or items in the form.

This feature enhances the usability of forms by ensuring users have access to additional information without cluttering the main form interface.

### Attributes section

Each widget in Aidbox Forms has its own set of customisable attributes that define its behavior, appearance, and functionality.

### Rules section

#### EnableWhen rule

EnableWhen option controls whether an item should be 'enabled' or not, but can handle more sophisticated circumstances. For example, it is possible to calculate a score based on the answer to several questions and then enable other questions based on the score. It's also possible to enable or disable questions based on data passed in as context or retrieved from queries.

Options for Setting EnableWhen Rules:

* `conditions` - define conditions using the "enableWhen" constructor.
* `expression` - use [FHIRPath](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/) expressions or [the FHIRPath Editor](fhirpath-editor.md) to describe the desired behavior.

{% hint style="info" %}
Be careful when using existence logic for EnableWhen rules. For example, the checkbox widget has `exists = false` when untouched and `exists = true` if the checkbox has been checked or unchecked. Use equality conditions instead.
{% endhint %}

#### Calculation rule

Calculated expression allows answers to questions to be calculated based on answers to other questions. For example, the determination of a score.

This expression will be most used for displaying scores, but can be used for any calculated element - patient age (based on current date and birth date), BMI (based on recent weight and height), estimated cost (based on selected items and quantities), etc.

How to use Calculated expression:

* Create custom [FHIR Path](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/) expressions in the code editor with autocomplete functionality or in [the FHIRPath Editor](fhirpath-editor.md) by clicking on `Visual mode` button .
* Utilize predefined templates under the "question" icon.

Named expressions can be used in data calculation process.\
They are useful for:

* splitting one complex calculatation to smaller ones
* storing intermediate calculations
* sharing common pre-calculation with other expressions

Named expressions will be available in current widget and it's child items (if they)\
Expressions can be referenced with %expr-name literal.

Example:

* Define expression with name `first-name` = `'%resource.repeat(item).where(linkId='first-name').answer.valueString'`
* Use defined variable via literal %first-name : `%first-name + %last-name`

### Data Extraction

Three options of data extraction are supported at the item level of Questionnaire: Observation-base, Definition-Based and Template-Based.

For detailed instructions and example of extracting data visit the[ Data Extraction page](data-extraction.md) and our [How-to guides](how-to-guides/how-to-extract-data-from-forms.md).

### Population

In order to pre-fill the form with data that is in the database. You need to define the incomming parameters for the widget, which will then be used in field that you want to pre-fill with data.

For detailed instructions and example of populating data visit the[ Population page](population.md) and our [How-to guides](how-to-guides/how-to-populate-forms-with-data.md).

### Extensions

Aidbox Forms provide ability to add and edit extensions that are not covered in Forms Builder. Users can edit raw Questionnaire json.

Extensions editor represents three fields for adding your own custom extension. To add extension you need follow three simple steps:

1. `URL` — write down your extension's Url;
2. `Type` — choose type of extension's value. Also you can write custom FHIRPath / FHIRQuery valueExpression just choose `Expression` type;
3. `Value` — pick a value.

{% hint style="info" %}
Known extensions can not be added
