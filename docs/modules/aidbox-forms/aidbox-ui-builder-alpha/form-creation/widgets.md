# Widgets

Aidbox Forms provides a set of widgets that allow you to build comprehensive and user-friendly medical forms. Widgets are pre-defined elements that you can add to your forms to capture various types of data from users.

This section details the various widgets available in Aidbox Forms and their corresponding settings.

## Common Widgetâ€™s Settings

In the widget settings, you can define various parameters that determine its appearance and behavior.

The user has the ability to change the widget type by clicking on the "change type" button in the upper right corner of the widget settings sidebar, while some of the settings for the current widget that the user entered will be saved, and some will need to be re-set.

Here are the main settings you can configure for most widgets.

### General section

#### LinkId

An identifier that is unique within the Questionnaire allowing linkage to the equivalent item in a QuestionnaireResponse resource.

It is generated automatically, but the user can change it.

#### System / Code / Display

The user can manually add several codes from different terminology systems (use 'add code' option). Or import this data from terminologies (use 'import code' option).

`Code` - a terminology code that corresponds to this group or question (e.g. a code from LOINC, which defines many questions and answers).

`System` - identity of the terminology system.

`Display` - representation defined by the system

#### Text

The Text field is used to define content for sections, questions, or display items within a form.

#### **Short Text**

The Short Text field provides an alternative, abbreviated version of the text. It is particularly useful when rendering forms on smaller screens, such as mobile devices, where space is limited.

#### Size

The Size parameter allows user to define the width of a widget and arrange multiple widgets horizontally within a form.

* The form layout is based on a 12-column grid system.
* By setting the size of a widget:
  * Maximum Size (12 columns): The widget will span the entire width of the form (by default)
  * Partial Size:
    * If one widget is set to a width of 6 columns and another to 6 columns, both widgets will be displayed side by side on the same line.
    * Similarly, setting widths like 4, 4, and 4 will arrange three widgets horizontally in a row.

#### Hidden, Required, Read Only, and Repeats Settings

* `Hidden:` Hides the form item from user view while still allowing it to be used internally or for conditional logic.
* `Required:` Ensures the user must provide input for the item before submitting the form.
* `Read Only:` Displays the form item as non-editable, allowing users to view but not modify its value.
* `Repeats:` Enables the user to dynamically add multiple instances of the same form item as needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
`Repeats` for Checkbox-list and Choice widgets have different behavior! When `Repeats` are enabled, it makes it possible to perform multi-choice actions within the widget.
{% endhint %}

#### Collapsible

Collapsible section is supported to enhance the usability and navigation of long questionnaires. This feature allows the child items of a group or question item to be displayed in a collapsible form, letting users toggle between showing and hiding nested items.

There are options:

1. `Not Collapsible`: The section is always fully expanded, and its child items are visible.
2. `Collapsible (Open by Default)`: The section is collapsible and starts in an expanded state. Users can collapse it if desired.
3. `Collapsible (Closed by Default)`: The section is collapsible and starts in a collapsed state. Users can expand it to view the child items.

User can set the desired collapsibility option for specific sections or items within the questionnaire.

### Media section

#### **Image & Video**

Allows you to add an image or video next to a form item, enhancing its visual appeal or providing additional context. The user needs to provide a publicly available URL for the image or video.

#### **Tooltip**

Displays additional information when the user clicks the question mark icon in the top-right corner of a field, offering guidance or clarification.

#### Support Link

The Support Link option allows you to associate an external or internal link with a question, group, or display item within a form. This is particularly useful for providing users with additional descriptive details or reference material.

* When a support link is added, an **icon** appears immediately.
* Users can click on the icon to navigate to the linked resource, typically displayed in a separate page or browser tab.

Use Cases:

* Providing contextual help or instructions for complex questions.
* Linking to guidelines, manuals, or regulatory references.
* Adding reference material for specific sections or items in the form.

This feature enhances the usability of forms by ensuring users have access to additional information without cluttering the main form interface.

### Attributes section

Each widget in Aidbox Forms has its own set of customisable attributes that define its behavior, appearance, and functionality.

### Rules section

#### EnableWhen rule

EnableWhen option controls whether an item should be 'enabled' or not, but can handle more sophisticated circumstances. For example, it is possible to calculate a score based on the answer to several questions and then enable other questions based on the score. It's also possible to enable or disable questions based on data passed in as context or retrieved from queries.

Options for Setting EnableWhen Rules:

* `conditions` - define conditions using the "enableWhen" constructor.
* `expression` - use [FHIRPath](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/) expressions or [the FHIRPath Editor](fhirpath-editor.md) to describe the desired behavior.

{% hint style="info" %}
Be careful when using existence logic for EnableWhen rules. For example, the checkbox widget has `exists = false` when untouched and `exists = true` if the checkbox has been checked or unchecked. Use equality conditions instead.
{% endhint %}

#### Calculation rule

Calculated expression allows answers to questions to be calculated based on answers to other questions. For example, the determination of a score.

This expression will be most used for displaying scores, but can be used for any calculated element - patient age (based on current date and birth date), BMI (based on recent weight and height), estimated cost (based on selected items and quantities), etc.

How to use Calculated expression:

* Create custom [FHIR Path](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/) expressions in the code editor with autocomplete functionality or in [the FHIRPath Editor](fhirpath-editor.md) by clicking on `Visual mode` button .
* Utilize predefined templates under the "question" icon.

Named expressions can be used in data calculation process.\
They are useful for:

* splitting one complex calculatation to smaller ones
* storing intermediate calculations
* sharing common pre-calculation with other expressions

Named expressions will be available in current widget and it's child items (if they)\
Expressions can be referenced with %expr-name literal.

Example:

* Define expression with name `first-name` = `'%resource.repeat(item).where(linkId='first-name').answer.valueString'`
* Use defined variable via literal %first-name : `%first-name + %last-name`

### Data extraction section

Aidbox Forms supports three options for data extraction: **Observation-Based**, **Definition-Based**, and **Template-Based**. These options provide flexibility in how form data is transformed into different FHIR resources.

**Observation-based extraction**

&#x20;It allows data collected through a Questionnaire Response (QR) to be extracted and stored in FHIR Observation resources.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that each item has both a **code** and a **system** defined.
{% endhint %}

**Current Logic:**

* A new Observation is created for each Questionnaire Response instance at the time of data extraction.
* If a QR is amended (modified after submission), the existing Observations linked to that QR are updated accordingly.

For detailed instructions and an example of extracting data into an Observation resource, visit the [Observation-Based Extraction Guide](how-to-guides/how-to-extract-data-from-forms.md#observation-based-extraction).



**Definition-based extraction**

It maps form data dynamically to the corresponding FHIR resources. When configuring extraction, you must specify a FHIR Path expression in the Path field. This expression defines the resource and field where the data should be extracted.

**Current Logic:**

Two Options for Resource Extraction:

* **New Resource**: If "new resource" is selected, a new resource is always created during extraction.Comment
* **Existing Resource:** If "existing resource" is selected, the system includes the `questionnaire-itemExtractionContext` extension. This extension can be added either at the root of the Questionnaire or at any item level. It identifies the resource that serves as the context for extraction.Comment

Using `itemExtractionContext`:

* Empty `itemExtractionContext`: When the `itemExtractionContext` is empty, the Questionnaire is used to create a new resource.
* Populated `itemExtractionContext`: If the `itemExtractionContext` contains a resource (or set of resources), the Questionnaire updates the existing resource.

For detailed instructions and an example of extracting data into a Patient resource, visit the [Definition-Based Extraction Guide](how-to-guides/how-to-extract-data-from-forms.md#definition-based-extraction).

#### Template-based extraction

It uses predefined templates embedded in the Questionnaire to extract answers into FHIR resource&#x73;**,** along with all the "boiler-plate" content for the resource that is to be extracted..

{% hint style="warning" %}
Template-based extraction is currently in **preview.** Not all functionality is available yet and may be subject to change.
{% endhint %}

#### &#x20;  **Current Logic:**

* Templates are included in the Questionnaire as **contained resources** and referenced using the [`sdc-questionnaire-templateExtract`](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-templateExtract.html) or [`sdc-questionnaire-templateExtractBundle`](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-templateExtractBundle.html) extensions.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `templateExtractBundle` extension is currently in development.
{% endhint %}

* There are two options where you can place the `templateExtract` extension:
  * **At the root level of the Questionnaire:** Used when you want to extract a single resource based on multiple answers from the form.
  * **At the item level:** Used when you want to extract data from specific questions or create a separate resource per repeated item.
* Data is mapped from answers in the QuestionnaireResponse into the template using FHIRPath expressions.
* Repeating items:
  * When `templateExtract` is placed on a repeatable item, the engine creates a new resource for each answer.
  * When extracting to a field that is an array (e.g., `Patient.address`), repeated answers can be added as multiple entries in the same resource.
* Use of the [`allocateId`](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/StructureDefinition-sdc-questionnaire-extractAllocateId.html) extension allows generation of unique IDs and referencing between related resources.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `allocateId` extensions are currently in development.
{% endhint %}

* If the template includes expressions that return no result, the corresponding field or entry is automatically excluded from the output.

**Steps to create a resource template:**

* Select a predefined resource template from existing ones, or create a new template.
* At this moment, the Resource Template Editor will be opened.
* Set up the template name.
* Select the resource type of the template you want to create (e.g., Patient, Observation).
* Search and prefill the fields that you need in this resource template.
* Test and debug the extraction using the debug console. For this purpose, enter test data in the form.
* Close the Resource Template Editor panel if everything is correct, or discard changes.

For detailed instructions and examples of using templates for data extraction, visit the Template-Based Extraction Guide.

### Population

Aidbox Forms provide three options for pre-filling the field:

1. **Initial Value**: For all fields except groups and display widgets, the user can set the default value. If the user does not change the value, this is what will appear in the completed QuestionnaireResponse.
2. **Observation:** Used to pre-fill a field with values â€‹â€‹that are stored in the database in the Observation resources. To do this, the user needs to select the time period during which these observations could have been made. The mechanism is described in more detail in the [FHIR SDC specification.](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/populate.html#observation-based-population)
3. **Expression:** This approach to population is more generic. It supports retrieving data from any queryable FHIR resources available in the database. Those queries can be based on the context in which the QuestionnaireResponse is being generated and/or on the results of other queries. The user needs to use [FHIRPath](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/) for this purpose or [The FHIRPath Editor](fhirpath-editor.md). For more detail go to the [FHIR SDC specification.](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/populate.html#expression-based-population)
