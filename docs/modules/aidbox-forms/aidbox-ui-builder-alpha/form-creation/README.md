# Form creation

There are three options to create form:

* Create a form in UI Builder (from scratch)
* Create a form from a form template that you can get from the Form Gallery. (The Form Gallery is available in every Aidbox instance.)
* Create a form from a FHIR Questionnaire or a PDF file ([Import Questionnaire](../import-fhir-questionnaire.md))
