# Subscriptions

Subscriptions enable real-time notifications and updates between servers and clients. This mechanism allows to respond dynamically to changes in patient data or resource states.\
\
By leveraging the subscriptions, developers can specify notification criteria, define delivery channels, and monitor specific events or changes in healthcare data. This push-based approach minimizes the need for constant polling, optimizing resource utilization and improving the timeliness of information dissemination.\
\
Aidbox provides several implementations of subscriptions. For enhanced capabilities and ongoing support, please use Aidbox topic-based subscriptions. This newer implementation offers improved performance, flexibility, and will continue to be developed to meet future needs.
