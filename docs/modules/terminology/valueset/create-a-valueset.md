# Create a ValueSet

There are two ways to get a ValueSet resource in Aidbox:

* [FHIR CRUD API](#crud). This way is described by the FHIR spec, good for testing, but may not be suitable for larger value sets or replicating the same configuration on different instances.
* [A terminology bundle import](../terminology-api/README.md). Aidbox offers a set of bulk import APIs for Aidbox run-time import and Aidbox start configuration.
