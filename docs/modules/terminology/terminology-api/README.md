# Import external terminologies

Aidbox allows you to import value sets content in several ways:

* [Ready-to-use terminologies](ready-to-use-terminologies.md). Our prepackaged versions of popular terminology distributions.
* [With the flat file import RPC](./import-flat-file-docs-csv.md). If you have your terminology as a CSV or any other kind of flat file data.
* [Via the /terminology/$import operation](usdimport-operation.md). If you have your terminology as a ndjson bundle.
