# DirectoryDownload Message

### Overview

The DirectoryDownload message is used to request and download directory information from the Surescripts network. This message allows for retrieving organization directory data, which includes pharmacies information.

### How to Send Directory Download Message

DirectoryDownload messages are handled automatically as part of the [pharmacies synchronization ](../pharmacies-synchronization.md)process. There is no need to manually send raw message, as the system manages this internally, where sending a message is only a one step.
