# DisableProviderLocation Message

### Overview

DisableProviderLocation is a message type used to disable an existing provider location in the Surescripts directory. This effectively removes a provider's ability to send electronic prescriptions from that location.

### How to Send DisableProviderLocation Message

To send a DisableProviderLocation message, use the following endpoint:`DELETE /directories/providers`

The required payload is a PractitionerRole identifier.

#### Required FHIR Resources

The following FHIR resource is needed to create a DisableProviderLocation message:

1. **PractitionerRole** (Required)
   * Must have SPI (Surescripts Provider ID) in identifiers
   * This is the only resource required for disabling a location

Unlike [Add](addproviderlocation-message.md) and [Update](updateproviderlocation-message.md) operations, DisableProviderLocation only requires the PractitionerRole resource with SPI, as this identifier is sufficient to identify the location that needs to be disabled.

### Response

#### Success Response (200 OK)

* Provider location is disabled in Surescripts directory
* SPI identifier is removed from the PractitionerRole resource

**Note:** This operation cannot be undone. To re-enable a location, you would need to submit a new AddProviderLocation message.

#### Error Responses

**400 Bad Request** â€“ Surescripts response error with details.

**422 Unprocessable Entity** - Various validation errors.

### Example
