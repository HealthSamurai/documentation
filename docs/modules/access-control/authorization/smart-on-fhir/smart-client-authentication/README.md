# SMART Client Authentication

When clients need to authenticate, SMART App Launch implementation guide defines two methods:

1. Authenticates a client using an asymmetric keypair. This is SMARTâ€™s preferred authentication method because it avoids sending a shared secret over the wire.

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

2. Authenticates a client using a secret that has been pre-shared between the client and server.

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}
