# Observability

Observability is a pivotal concept when it comes to Aidbox and its observability module. It empowers users to gain profound insights into the complex workings of the system. Observability equips Aidbox administrators with the tools they need to troubleshoot issues effectively and address unexpected challenges.

Aidbox emits three types of signals such as traces, metrics, and logs. All in OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) format.\
