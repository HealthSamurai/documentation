# Patient Encounter notification Application

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is outdated tutorial. We do not support Clojure SDK anymore.
{% endhint %}

In this tutorial, we will create a simple application written on [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) programming language using [Aidbox Clojure SDK](https://github.com/Aidbox/aidbox-clojure-sdk) and Aidbox.cloud or [Aidboxone](https://www.health-samurai.io/aidbox) as a backend.

All source code available on [Github Aidbox/app-mailgun-clj](https://github.com/Aidbox/app-mailgun-clj)

### Problem statement

We have a Encounter included Patient, date and location of visit.

We want to send an Email to a patient with a notification of the upcoming visit. In this email we want to show the Patient information, time and location of the visit. These notifications should be sent the day before the visit.

### Architecture

Aidbox as backend which will store all Encounters. .....

Clojure application with Aidbox Clojure SDK as a connector between our application and backend.

For sending Emails we will use [MailGun](https://www.mailgun.com/) service as the easiest way to send emails instead SMPT.

### Get started

Firstly, you need to install local Aidbox. See the full instruction on how to [install Aidbox locally](broken-reference) and [how to use Rest API](https://docs.aidbox.app/api-1/api)

In this sample application, we use Clojure CLI. See [Getting Started](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) for details on how to install the tools.

### Enable Aidbox SDK

In this sample app we will use Clojure Cli - command line tools for running REPL and Clojure apps. In `deps.end` file need specify `aidbox-sdk` as a reference to git.

{% code title="deps.edn" %}
```java
{:deps 
  {aidbox-sdk {:git/url "https://github.com/Aidbox/aidbox-clojure-sdk" 
               :sha "057ebd1a542bb17c7a910283ae942f56a89167f1"}}}
```
{% endcode %}

And then require `aidbox-sdk` in the main `mailgun.core` file

{% code title="mailgun.core" %}
```java
(ns mailgun.core
  (:require [aidbox.sdk.core :as aidbox]))
```
{% endcode %}

### Connect your app with Aidbox

For connecting your application with Aidbox, you need call `aidbox/call` method send them information about the location of Aidbox and your application.

{% code title="src/mailgun/core.clj" %}
```java
(def manifest
  {:id "mailgun-app"
   :type "app"
   :env {:box {;; host and port of Aidbox instance
               :host "localhost"
               :scheme "http"
               :port 8888}
         :app {;; host, port and client creds of your application
               ;;:host "docker.for.mac.localhost"  ;; for Mac Os
               :host "localhost"
               :scheme "http"
               :port 8989
               :id "root"
               :secret "secret"}}})

(defn -main [] (aidbox/start manifest))
```
{% endcode %}

#### How it works?

When you call `aidbox/start` method, `aidbox-sdk` try to connect to `Aidbox` with given `env.box.host` , `env.app.id` and `env.app.secret` credentials and then, if the connection is successful, register your app in Aidbox. After that, `aidbox/sdk` create local web server running on `env.app.port` port, in our case is `8989`.
