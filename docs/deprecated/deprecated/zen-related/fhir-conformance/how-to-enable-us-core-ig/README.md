{% hint style="warning" %}
This tutorial is deprecated. Since the 2405 release, using Aidbox in FHIRSchema mode is recommended, which is incompatible with zen or Entity/Attribute options.

Enabling US Core IG allows you to use its various features in Aidbox.

If you are just starting out with Aidbox, proceed to the following page:

{% content-ref url="start-aidbox-with-us-core-ig-enabled.md" %}
[start-aidbox-with-us-core-ig-enabled.md](start-aidbox-with-us-core-ig-enabled.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you already have a running Aidbox instance, proceed to the following page:

{% content-ref url="add-us-core-ig-to-a-running-aidbox-instance.md" %}
[add-us-core-ig-to-a-running-aidbox-instance.md](add-us-core-ig-to-a-running-aidbox-instance.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
