# Start Aidbox locally with US Core IG enabled

{% hint style="warning" %}
This tutorial is deprecated. Since the 2405 release, using Aidbox in FHIRSchema mode is recommended, which is incompatible with zen or Entity/Attribute options.

[setup.md](../../../../../modules/profiling-and-validation/fhir-schema-validator/setup.md)
{% endhint %}

## Steps

You need to go through the following steps:

1. Set up base Aidbox instance
2. Specify US Core as a dependency
3. Commit changes to your Aidbox configuration project
4. Start Aidbox and verify that IGs are enabled

All of them are covered in a greater detail below.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are new to Aidbox it is strongly recommended not to skip any steps. Otherwise you may end up with a misconfigured instance.
{% endhint %}

### Set up base Aidbox instance

Set up Aidbox instance by following our [quick start guide](../../../../../getting-started/run-aidbox-locally.md).

### Specify US Core as a dependency

Put the following content in `project/zen-package.edn`:

```clojure
{:deps {hl7-fhir-us-core "https://github.com/zen-fhir/hl7-fhir-us-core.git"}}
```

Go to the main configuration file for your system (`project/zrc/system.edn` if you followed the quick start guide from above) and add `hl7-fhir-us-core` namespace to imports. It should look like this:

```clojure
{…
 :import #{aidbox hl7-fhir-us-core maybe-some-other-deps}
 …}
```

Commit the changes you just made:

```shell
cd project && git add . && git commit -m "Add us-core dependency" && cd ..
```

Commit step is necessary as we are using [Aidbox configuration project](../../aidbox-zen-lang-project/) which is a git repository under the hood.

### Start Aidbox

Start Aidbox by running the following command:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

It should be available now at `http://localhost:8888`.

#### Database implications

Note that US Core IG takes about 1.5GB in the database. You can significantly reduce this size by disabling the loading of Concepts, ValueSets and CodeSystems. For that you need to set `BOX_FEATURES_FTR_PULL_ENABLE=true|false`.

You’ll still be able to [validate codes from ValueSets](../../../../../modules/terminology/valueset/value-set-validation.md) but [Concept lookups](../../../../../modules/terminology/codesystem-and-concept/concept-lookup.md) and [ValueSet expansions](../../../../../modules/terminology/valueset/value-set-expansion.md) as well as `GET /Concept`, `GET /ValueSet` and `GET /CodeSystem` endpoints won’t work. Lookups and expansions without loading into database are currently work in progress

### Verify that US Core IG works

{% hint style="warning" %}
By default, Aidbox does not load terminologies into the database in order to save the disk space. This still allows you to use them for validation but terminology server functionality won’t be available. If you do wish to load the terminologies, you need to set `BOX_FEATURES_FTR_PULL_ENABLE=true` environment variable.
{% endhint %}

Go to “Profiles” page in the Aidbox UI (`http://localhost:8888/ui/zen-ui`) and make sure that `hl7-fhir-us-core` is listed among the namespaces.

You can also verify that validation with US Core IG works. For that you can make the following HTTP requests and check that response statuses are returned as expected.

{% code title="Status: 201" %}
```
POST /Patient
content-type: text/yaml
accept: text/yaml

meta:
  profile:
    - "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient"
birthsex: "F"
gender: "female"
name:
  - {use: "anonymous"}
identifier:
  - {system: "some-system", value: "unique-value"}
```
{% endcode %}

This request checks that valid values for `birthsex` field are allowed.

{% code title="Status: 422" %}
```
POST /Patient
content-type: text/yaml
accept: text/yaml

meta:
  profile:
    - "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient"
birthsex: "SOMETHING-UNKNOWN"
gender: "female"
name:
  - {use: "anonymous"}
identifier:
  - {system: "some-system", value: "unique-value"}
```
{% endcode %}

This request checks that invalid values for `birthsex` field are not allowed.
