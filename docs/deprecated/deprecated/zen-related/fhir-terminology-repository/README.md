**FTR** (FHIR Terminology Repository) it's an open specification for repository layout, formats and algorithms to distribute FHIR terminologies as ValueSets.

You can store the resulting FTR on s3 like storage or a regular file system. Aidbox team provides tools for the FTR population and distribution mechanism via zen-packages. Aidbox can sync FTR's come with zen-packages and as a result, validate/lookup ValueSets.
