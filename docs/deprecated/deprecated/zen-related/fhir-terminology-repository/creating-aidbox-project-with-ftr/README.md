# Create an FTR instance

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since the 2405 release, using Aidbox in FHIRSchema mode is recommended, which is incompatible with zen or Entity/Attribute options.

You can create an FTR instance in the following ways:

* [FTR from CSV](ftr-from-csv.md)

* [FTR from FHIR IG](ftr-from-fhir-ig.md)

* [FTR from FTR â€” Direct Dependency](ftr-from-ftr-direct-dependency.md)
