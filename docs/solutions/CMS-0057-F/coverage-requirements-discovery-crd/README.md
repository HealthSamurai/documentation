# Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD)

## Overview

The Aidbox Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD) implementation enables real-time communication between EHR systems and payers to determine documentation and prior authorization requirements at the point of care. Built on the [HL7 Da Vinci Coverage Requirements Discovery Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd/), it helps providers understand payer requirements before ordering services.

When combined with Documentation Templates and Rules (DTR) and [Prior Authorization Support (PAS)](../prior-authorization-support-pas-api.md), CRD ensures that providers are informed of coverage requirements early in the workflow, reducing claim denials and improving the authorization process.
