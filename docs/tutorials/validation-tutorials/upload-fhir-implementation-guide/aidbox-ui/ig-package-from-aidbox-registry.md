# IG Package from Aidbox Registry

Aidbox has its own registry of IG packages with guaranteed uptime. The content of the registry is synchronized daily, fetching available public packages.

### 1. Run Aidbox with FHIR Schema Validation Engine

### 2. Open the Aidbox UI

1. Navigate to the **FHIR Packages** page
2. Go to the **Import FHIR Package** sidebar section
3. Choose a package via the dropdown from the "**Choose packages from the registry**" section
