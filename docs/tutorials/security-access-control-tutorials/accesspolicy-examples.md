## 1. Policy that **temporarily** allows all requests

**Description:**
We need to allow all requests for testing purposes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Never use this policy in production.
{% endhint %}

**Policy:**
```yaml
id: allow-all
resourceType: AccessPolicy
engine: allow
```

**Request to test the policy:**

```http
GET /fhir/Patient
```

## 2. Policy that allows a user to view their own patient

**Description:**
User is registered in Aidbox as a `User` resource with patient id stored in `User.fhirUser` element. We want to allow the user to view their own patient data

**Policy:**
```yaml
id: as-patient-get-patient-data
resourceType: AccessPolicy
engine: matcho
link:
  - reference: Operation/FhirRead

description: Policy that allows a patient to view their own patient data
matcho:
  params:
    resource/id: .user.fhirUser.id
    resource/type: Patient

```

**Request to test the policy:**

```http
GET /fhir/Patient/123
```

## 3. Policy that allows a practitioner to view all observations

**Description:**
User is registered in Aidbox as a `User` resource. 
A `Role` resource is assigned to the user, that links to the `Practitioner` instance:
```yaml
name: practitioner-1
resourceType: Role
user:
  reference: User/user-1
links:
  practitioner:
    reference: Practitioner/pr-1

```
We want to allow the practitioner to view all observations.

id: as-practitioner-get-all-observations
resourceType: AccessPolicy
link:
  - reference: Operation/FhirSearch
engine: matcho
matcho:
  session:
    role:
      $contains:
        links:

## 4. Policy that allows a system to update their patients

**Description:**
We have a couple of systems. Each system maintains their own patients with identifiers. We want to allow these systems to update their patients - patients that have identifiers from their own system.

## 11. Policy that allows all the requests with JWT issued by certain issuer

**Description:**
[Token introspector](../../tutorials/security-access-control-tutorials/set-up-token-introspection.md) is configured in Aidbox to trust JWT issued by certain issuer - `https://auth.example.com`. We want to allow all the requests with JWT issued by this issuer.

```

## 13. Policy that allows the practitioner to read patients based on given consent.

**Description:**
Consent is stored in Aidbox as a `Consent` resource, with practitioner id stored in `Consent.actor` element. Practitioner is registered in Aidbox as a `User` resource with practitioner id stored in `User.data.practitioner_id` element. We want to allow the practitioner to read patients based on given consent.

**Policy:**
```yaml

Practitioner is registered in Aidbox as a `User` resource with practitioner id stored in `User.data.practitioner_id` element. We want to allow the practitioner to create observations for their patients. The relation between the practitioner and the patient is stored in `Patient.generalPractitioner` element.

**Policy:**
```yaml
id: as-practitioner-allowed-to-create-observations-for-their-patients
resourceType: AccessPolicy
engine: complex
link:
  - reference: Operation/FhirCreate
description: Allow practitioner to create observations for their patients     
and: 
  - engine: matcho
    matcho:
      params:
        resource/type: Observation
      user: present?
      user: 
        data:
          practitioner_id: present?
  - engine: sql   
    sql:
      query: |-
        SELECT
          EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM patient p
            WHERE p.id = split_part(({{resource.subject.reference}})::text, '/',2)
            AND p.resource->'generalPractitioner' @>
              jsonb_build_array(
                jsonb_build_object(
                  'resourceType', 'Practitioner',
                  'id', {{user.data.practitioner_id}}::text
                )
              )
          );
```

**Request to test the policy:**

```http
POST /fhir/Observation
Content-Type: text/yaml
Accept: text/yaml

resourceType: Observation
status: final
code:
  coding:
    - system: http://loinc.org
      code: "29463-7"
      display: Body Weight

valueQuantity:
  value: 72
  unit: kg
  system: http://unitsofmeasure.org
  code: kg
```

## 15. Policy that denies a system to update "protected" resources

**Description:**
We have a system that is registered as a `Client` resource in Aidbox. We want to allow this system to update all the Practitioner resources except the ones with `meta.source` equal to `MDM`.

**Policy:**
```yaml
id: as-system-allowed-to-update-practitioners-except-mdm
resourceType: AccessPolicy
engine: complex
link:
  - reference: Operation/FhirUpdate
description: Allow practitioner to create observations for their patients     
and: 
  - engine: matcho
    matcho:
      params:
        resource/type: Practitioner
  - engine: sql   
    sql:
      query: |-
        SELECT resource -> 'meta' ->> 'source' IS NULL OR  resource -> 'meta' ->> 'source' != 'MDM'  FROM practitioner WHERE id = {{params.resource/id}};
```          

**Request to test the policy:**

```http
PUT /fhir/Practitioner/pr-1
Authorization: Basic <base64(system1-client:client-secret)> # Base64 encoded client-id and client-secret

{
  "name": [
    {
      "given": [
        "John"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 15. Policy that allows only read operations to $sql endpoint
This policy restricts access to the $sql endpoint by allowing only read-only SQL queries (such as `SELECT`). Any write or schema-modifying operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, etc.) are explicitly denied, ensuring that the endpoint can be used safely for querying data without risk of altering the database.

```yaml
engine: matcho
matcho:
  uri: /$sql
  body:
    sql: "#^(?i)(?!.*(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|MERGE|COPY|CREATE|ALTER|DROP|GRANT|REVOKE|TRUNCATE|CALL|DO|COMMENT|VACUUM|ANALYZE)).*"
  request-method: post
```
